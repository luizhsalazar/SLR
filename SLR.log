D, [2015-07-23T20:15:20.983216 #11040] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper focuses on the intrinsic aspects of power management for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in HEVs (PHEV). A vehicle power distribution density function is used to describe the drive cycle characteristics. An electric driveline loss is introduced to describe the minimum system loss for a given mechanical power output, and a piecewise linear fuel consumption model is used to capture essential characteristics such as idle fuel consumption rate, peak efficiency, and the minimum power to reach peak efficiency. Models are based on the assumption that both machines operate at the optimal speed and torque for a given mechanical power as if they are coupled with an ideal continuous variable transmission (CVT). The power management strategy is represented with a pair of power parameters that describe the power threshold for turning on the engine and the optimum battery power in engine-on operations. The model of a parallel hybrid electric powertrain is constructed to obtain optimal solutions that maximize the fuel economy for a given battery energy depletion and for a general vehicle power distribution density function. One-dimensional loss models of two power sources as approximations to real machines coupled with hypothetic CVTs are introduced to solve the optimization problem analytically. It is found that the optimal minimum engine power is the controlling factor in minimizing the total fuel consumption for the given battery energy depletion targets and that the optimal power is solely determined by powertrain characteristics. Numerical simulations validated the properties of the optimal power solutions obtained through analytic approaches. The significance of the results to real-world HEV and PHEV applications are also discussed.

Design of the drive train components for the desired performance of the vehicle no longer based on different formulae. Fuel economy and emission have become the basic constraint. Automaker has to take care of the road transport policies also before deciding the sizes of the drive train components. Modeling and simulation based design method has been adopted by many researchers and automakers. The sizes of drive train components are optimized for the desired performance of vehicle. NERL ADVISOR is one such vehicle simulation software which is used for sizing of the drive train components of HEV. This paper uses simulation on ADVISOR to size the drive train components of hybrid Electric Vehicle for the desired performance.

D, [2015-07-23T20:15:20.989708 #11040] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Beginning in 1990, the major automotive passenger vehicle manufacturers once again re-evaluated the potential of the battery powered electric vehicle (EV). This intensive effort to reduce the battery EV to commercial practice focused attention on the key issue of limited vehicle range, resulting from the low energy density and high mass characteristics of batteries, in comparison to the high energy density of liquid hydrocarbon (HC) fuels. Consequently, by 1995, vehicle manufacturers turned their attention to hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). This redirection of EV effort was highlighted finally in 1997, at the 57th Frankfurt Motor Show, the Audi Duo parallel type hybrid was released for the domestic market as a 1998 model vehicle. Also at the 1997 32nd Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota Hybrid System (THS) Prius was released for the domestic market as a production 1998 model vehicle. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the key features of these two 1998 model year production hybrid systems. Among the conclusions, two issues are evident: one, the major manufacturers have turned to the hybrid concept in their search for solutions to the key EV issues of limited range; and, heating/air conditioning; and two, the focus is now on introducing hybrid EV for test marketing domestically

D, [2015-07-23T20:15:20.992595 #11040] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Four light duty gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles (Toyota Prius, Honda Civic, Honda Insight and Ford Escape) were tested over five different driving cycles at two temperatures using chassis dynamometer emissions testing procedures. The vehicles were tested at 20degC and -18degC. Second-by-second gaseous emissions and total particle number emissions from the hybrid vehicles show patterns that are in some ways similar to conventional multiport fuel injected gasoline vehicles, with large increases in concentration on accelerations. Under driving conditions where the engine may be turned off and on, or under conditions where the electric drive assists in accelerations, different patterns are observed. These patterns can also differ from one repeat of a driving cycle to another, depending on the state of charge of the battery. Cold temperature operation is very demanding on the electric system of the hybrids. The batteries are challenged not only in starting the vehicle but in retaining charge during operation. These conditions result in much higher fuel consumption and mass emission rates of pollutants and greenhouse gases as compared to standard temperature operation and also greatly influence the transient nature of emissions from these vehicles.

The test bench, which is implemented using relatively low-cost off-the-shelf products, is capable of serving a broad variety of purposes ranging from the design and test of propulsion motor drives to the implementation of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) powertrain control strategies. This paper illustrates the test bench capabilities by (a) simulating the Jeep Commander II, a fuel cell sport utility vehicle (SUV) from Daimler-Chrysler, performing the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS), (b) simulating the Prius, a commercially available gasoline-electric hybrid compact car from Toyota, performing the Japanese "10-15 mode" driving schedule, and (c) determining the efficiency map of a three-phase induction motor (IM). Additionally, the test bench could be also used as a dynamic simulator for renewable energy sources such as wind turbine generators.

D, [2015-07-23T20:15:21.002311 #11040] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper addresses system design and integration challenges involved in meeting the requirements for coordinated deployment of Intelligent Hybrid Vehicle Systems. A hybrid vehicle can run purely on a gas engine, purely on an electric motor, or a combination of both. Advanced hybrid vehicles are designed to use a vehicle management system that integrates many subsystem functions into one system. However, many recent hybrid vehicles do not focus on the utilization of decision support techniques for the implementation of system design. The decision support design emphasizes a driver-oriented and automatic-oriented drive-by-wire vehicle system. The top-down functional decomposition and bottom-up physical integration design methodologies help to create an augmented functional analysis in the device level software. The significant portions are devoted to introducing the design stages and establishing the hybrid vehicle management system.

A novel unipolar/interleaved PWM switching scheme is proposed, which can significantly reduce the switching losses and substantially increase the efficiency. A dual inverter drive prototype was assembled to test the PWM control schemes and test results are included to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

It has many benefits over its predecessors, which developed power using only fuel. The thought is to design and construct a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) powered by battery as well as petrol. The vehicle is made dynamic in nature by making use of electrical power from battery and fuel power. It consumes less fuel and creates comparatively less pollution as compared to conventional vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles consists of a battery, to drive the electric motor and power system with an IC engine to increase fuel economy reduce harmful emissions from the exhaust. Also there is a provision for recharging the battery using a generator which is run using a turbine, which runs on the exhaust of the IC engine. In HEV, the battery single handedly provides power for driving at low speeds where the efficiency of IC engine is least. In cruising and high load conditions like moving up the hill, the electric power assists the engine by providing additional power. Thus the HEV is the best alternative in areas with high traffic like urban metropolitan cities.

Two operating objectives are identified, one for energy saving and the other for substituting petroleum fuel by electrical energy. The way in which the power train control and component rating can be optimised to meet these particular operating objectives is discussed. In the final part of the paper the performance of the optimised hybrid vehicles are compared with both IC engine and electric vehicles and the petroleum substitution design is shown to warrant further development.

This is achieved by considering a reference electric car of 3150-lb weight similar in body construction, aerodynamics, and rolling resistance to a conventional heat engine car of equal weight, and comparing the performance of the two cars over the same driving modes. The reference electric car is then used as a baseline to evaluate the possible improvements in future electric cars. The energy consumption for an optimized 2000-lb electric car of driving range, comfort, and performance comparable to a conventional car is estimated. Assuming a gradual growth in electric car population leading to their widespread use by the 1990's, the impact on electric power generation and distribution systems is estimated. Though the analysis is based on a high energy and power density battery the results may be extrapolated to electric cars using lower performance batteries. It is noted that batteries with lower energy density can provide sufficient driving range to fulfill a significant portion of our transportation needs and their continued development and improvement will accelerate the achievement of the high energy-density goal [1].

D, [2015-07-23T20:15:21.046307 #11040] DEBUG -- : Abstract: The application of batteries and ultracapacitors in electric energy storage units for battery powered (EV) and charge sustaining and plug-in hybrid-electric (HEV and PHEV) vehicles have been studied in detail. The use of IC engines and hydrogen fuel cells as the primary energy converters for the hybrid vehicles was considered. The study focused on the use of lithium-ion batteries and carbon/carbon ultracapacitors as the energy storage technologies most likely to be used in future vehicles. The key findings of the study are as follows. 1) The energy density and power density characteristics of both battery and ultracapacitor technologies are sufficient for the design of attractive EVs, HEVs, and PHEVs. 2) Charge sustaining, engine powered hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) can be designed using either batteries or ultracapacitors with fuel economy improvements of 50% and greater. 3) Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) can be designed with effective all-electric ranges of 30-60 km using lithium-ion batteries that are relatively small. The effective fuel economy of the PHEVs can be very high (greater than 100 mpg) for long daily driving ranges (80-150 km) resulting in a large fraction (greater than 75%) of the energy to power the vehicle being grid electricity. 4) Mild hybrid-electric vehicles (MHEVs) can be designed using ultracapacitors having an energy storage capacity of 75-150 Wh. The fuel economy improvement with the ultracapacitors is 10%-15% higher than with the same weight of batteries due to the higher efficiency of the ultracapacitors and more efficient engine operation. 5) Hybrid-electric vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells can use either batteries or ultracapacitors for energy storage. Simulation results indicate the equivalent fuel economy of the fuel cell powered vehicles is 2-3 times higher than that of a gasoline fueled IC vehicle of the same weight and road load. Compared to an engine-powered HEV, the equivalent fuel economy of the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle wou- - ld be 1.66-2.0 times higher

The analytical approach is based on the energy balance equations, whereas the simulation approach is based on an accurate and fast forward-facing simulation model for simulating parallel and series hybrid powertrains. A very good agreement between simulation and analytical results gives confidence pertaining to the accuracy of the performed analysis and confirms the validity of the analytical framework. Thus, combined simulation and analytical analysis enables deep insight into the energy conversion phenomena in hybrid powertrains and reveals the advantages and disadvantages of both hybrid concepts running under different operating conditions. It is obvious from the presented results that the parallel hybrid powertrain features better fuel economy than the series one for the applied test cycles, whereas both hybrid powertrain concepts feature the best fuel economy at light-duty application.

Designing a hybrid drive train is a multiobjective design problem. The main design objectives are fuel consumption, emissions, and performance. However, it is difficult to find a global optimal integral design solution due to the interdependence of design choices (parameters) regarding the drive-train topology, component sizes, component technologies, and control strategy, as well as the unknown sensitivity of the design objectives to the design parameters. In this paper, a parametric optimization procedure is presented to solve the design problem, where the main design objective is fuel consumption. The effects of parameter variation on fuel consumption have been investigated. Furthermore, a reduced hybrid drive-train model is introduced, with which the effects of design parameter variation is very quickly studied with an average error of less than 1.6%.

Now, several auto manufacturers are preparing for the commercial launches of battery powered electric vehicles in 2011. Another battle for dominance in electric car market has started. However, the development of technologies for electric cars has a very long history and presently there is a huge diversity of technological solutions in development. In order to understand the evolution of electric vehicles, we carried out two related case studies. In the first case study, we analyze the experience of General Motors in the last 40 years in developing electric vehicles. Our focuses are on the objectives of each development, technologies employed and external factors that stimulated each effort. The results show that in the first 20 years the main objective is to explore different technologies. The intention to launch a commercial electric vehicle only appears in the last 20 years. In the second case study, we analyze propulsion technologies and product architectures electric vehicles announced, in the last few years, by established auto manufacturers and new entrants. The results show that innovations in product architecture can provide a niche market for electric vehicles.

In China, the EV demonstrations have been carried out in 25 cities under the support of Chinese government. The industrialization of EVs is urgent and many problems exist for the sharp increase of the EVs market. Based on the summarization of the state-of-art in EVs and its key components like motor drive system, battery, controller and the infrastructure, the main problems are deduced. The corresponding key technologies are listed and the possible solutions are discussed. Taking Beijing as an example, the achievements of the EV industrialization are introduced. Also the successful mass applications of the battery electric buses in 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, 2010 Shanghai Expo and Guangzhou Asian Games are introduced in details. Finally, the possible solutions and some advices are put forward for the industrialization of EVs from the aspects of research, production, test and policy.
