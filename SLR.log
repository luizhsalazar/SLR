D, [2015-07-23T20:23:13.371144 #11365] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper focuses on the intrinsic aspects of power management for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in HEVs (PHEV). A vehicle power distribution density function is used to describe the drive cycle characteristics. An electric driveline loss is introduced to describe the minimum system loss for a given mechanical power output, and a piecewise linear fuel consumption model is used to capture essential characteristics such as idle fuel consumption rate, peak efficiency, and the minimum power to reach peak efficiency. Models are based on the assumption that both machines operate at the optimal speed and torque for a given mechanical power as if they are coupled with an ideal continuous variable transmission (CVT). The power management strategy is represented with a pair of power parameters that describe the power threshold for turning on the engine and the optimum battery power in engine-on operations. The model of a parallel hybrid electric powertrain is constructed to obtain optimal solutions that maximize the fuel economy for a given battery energy depletion and for a general vehicle power distribution density function. One-dimensional loss models of two power sources as approximations to real machines coupled with hypothetic CVTs are introduced to solve the optimization problem analytically. It is found that the optimal minimum engine power is the controlling factor in minimizing the total fuel consumption for the given battery energy depletion targets and that the optimal power is solely determined by powertrain characteristics. Numerical simulations validated the properties of the optimal power solutions obtained through analytic approaches. The significance of the results to real-world HEV and PHEV applications are also discussed.

Design of the drive train components for the desired performance of the vehicle no longer based on different formulae. Fuel economy and emission have become the basic constraint. Automaker has to take care of the road transport policies also before deciding the sizes of the drive train components. Modeling and simulation based design method has been adopted by many researchers and automakers. The sizes of drive train components are optimized for the desired performance of vehicle. NERL ADVISOR is one such vehicle simulation software which is used for sizing of the drive train components of HEV. This paper uses simulation on ADVISOR to size the drive train components of hybrid Electric Vehicle for the desired performance.

D, [2015-07-23T20:23:13.377443 #11365] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Beginning in 1990, the major automotive passenger vehicle manufacturers once again re-evaluated the potential of the battery powered electric vehicle (EV). This intensive effort to reduce the battery EV to commercial practice focused attention on the key issue of limited vehicle range, resulting from the low energy density and high mass characteristics of batteries, in comparison to the high energy density of liquid hydrocarbon (HC) fuels. Consequently, by 1995, vehicle manufacturers turned their attention to hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). This redirection of EV effort was highlighted finally in 1997, at the 57th Frankfurt Motor Show, the Audi Duo parallel type hybrid was released for the domestic market as a 1998 model vehicle. Also at the 1997 32nd Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota Hybrid System (THS) Prius was released for the domestic market as a production 1998 model vehicle. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the key features of these two 1998 model year production hybrid systems. Among the conclusions, two issues are evident: one, the major manufacturers have turned to the hybrid concept in their search for solutions to the key EV issues of limited range; and, heating/air conditioning; and two, the focus is now on introducing hybrid EV for test marketing domestically

D, [2015-07-23T20:23:13.380601 #11365] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Four light duty gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles (Toyota Prius, Honda Civic, Honda Insight and Ford Escape) were tested over five different driving cycles at two temperatures using chassis dynamometer emissions testing procedures. The vehicles were tested at 20degC and -18degC. Second-by-second gaseous emissions and total particle number emissions from the hybrid vehicles show patterns that are in some ways similar to conventional multiport fuel injected gasoline vehicles, with large increases in concentration on accelerations. Under driving conditions where the engine may be turned off and on, or under conditions where the electric drive assists in accelerations, different patterns are observed. These patterns can also differ from one repeat of a driving cycle to another, depending on the state of charge of the battery. Cold temperature operation is very demanding on the electric system of the hybrids. The batteries are challenged not only in starting the vehicle but in retaining charge during operation. These conditions result in much higher fuel consumption and mass emission rates of pollutants and greenhouse gases as compared to standard temperature operation and also greatly influence the transient nature of emissions from these vehicles.

The test bench, which is implemented using relatively low-cost off-the-shelf products, is capable of serving a broad variety of purposes ranging from the design and test of propulsion motor drives to the implementation of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) powertrain control strategies. This paper illustrates the test bench capabilities by (a) simulating the Jeep Commander II, a fuel cell sport utility vehicle (SUV) from Daimler-Chrysler, performing the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS), (b) simulating the Prius, a commercially available gasoline-electric hybrid compact car from Toyota, performing the Japanese "10-15 mode" driving schedule, and (c) determining the efficiency map of a three-phase induction motor (IM). Additionally, the test bench could be also used as a dynamic simulator for renewable energy sources such as wind turbine generators.

D, [2015-07-23T20:23:13.389066 #11365] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper addresses system design and integration challenges involved in meeting the requirements for coordinated deployment of Intelligent Hybrid Vehicle Systems. A hybrid vehicle can run purely on a gas engine, purely on an electric motor, or a combination of both. Advanced hybrid vehicles are designed to use a vehicle management system that integrates many subsystem functions into one system. However, many recent hybrid vehicles do not focus on the utilization of decision support techniques for the implementation of system design. The decision support design emphasizes a driver-oriented and automatic-oriented drive-by-wire vehicle system. The top-down functional decomposition and bottom-up physical integration design methodologies help to create an augmented functional analysis in the device level software. The significant portions are devoted to introducing the design stages and establishing the hybrid vehicle management system.

A novel unipolar/interleaved PWM switching scheme is proposed, which can significantly reduce the switching losses and substantially increase the efficiency. A dual inverter drive prototype was assembled to test the PWM control schemes and test results are included to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

It has many benefits over its predecessors, which developed power using only fuel. The thought is to design and construct a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) powered by battery as well as petrol. The vehicle is made dynamic in nature by making use of electrical power from battery and fuel power. It consumes less fuel and creates comparatively less pollution as compared to conventional vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles consists of a battery, to drive the electric motor and power system with an IC engine to increase fuel economy reduce harmful emissions from the exhaust. Also there is a provision for recharging the battery using a generator which is run using a turbine, which runs on the exhaust of the IC engine. In HEV, the battery single handedly provides power for driving at low speeds where the efficiency of IC engine is least. In cruising and high load conditions like moving up the hill, the electric power assists the engine by providing additional power. Thus the HEV is the best alternative in areas with high traffic like urban metropolitan cities.

Two operating objectives are identified, one for energy saving and the other for substituting petroleum fuel by electrical energy. The way in which the power train control and component rating can be optimised to meet these particular operating objectives is discussed. In the final part of the paper the performance of the optimised hybrid vehicles are compared with both IC engine and electric vehicles and the petroleum substitution design is shown to warrant further development.

D, [2015-07-23T20:23:13.419777 #11365] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Assuming the availability of a high energy and power density battery of 100 Wh/lb and 100 W/lb by the 1980' s, the energy consumption and efficiency of electric and heat engine cars are compared on an equal basis. This is achieved by considering a reference electric car of 3150-lb weight similar in body construction, aerodynamics, and rolling resistance to a conventional heat engine car of equal weight, and comparing the performance of the two cars over the same driving modes. The reference electric car is then used as a baseline to evaluate the possible improvements in future electric cars. The energy consumption for an optimized 2000-lb electric car of driving range, comfort, and performance comparable to a conventional car is estimated. Assuming a gradual growth in electric car population leading to their widespread use by the 1990's, the impact on electric power generation and distribution systems is estimated. Though the analysis is based on a high energy and power density battery the results may be extrapolated to electric cars using lower performance batteries. It is noted that batteries with lower energy density can provide sufficient driving range to fulfill a significant portion of our transportation needs and their continued development and improvement will accelerate the achievement of the high energy-density goal [1].

D, [2015-07-23T20:23:13.435195 #11365] DEBUG -- : Abstract: The application of batteries and ultracapacitors in electric energy storage units for battery powered (EV) and charge sustaining and plug-in hybrid-electric (HEV and PHEV) vehicles have been studied in detail. The use of IC engines and hydrogen fuel cells as the primary energy converters for the hybrid vehicles was considered. The study focused on the use of lithium-ion batteries and carbon/carbon ultracapacitors as the energy storage technologies most likely to be used in future vehicles. The key findings of the study are as follows. 1) The energy density and power density characteristics of both battery and ultracapacitor technologies are sufficient for the design of attractive EVs, HEVs, and PHEVs. 2) Charge sustaining, engine powered hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) can be designed using either batteries or ultracapacitors with fuel economy improvements of 50% and greater. 3) Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) can be designed with effective all-electric ranges of 30-60 km using lithium-ion batteries that are relatively small. The effective fuel economy of the PHEVs can be very high (greater than 100 mpg) for long daily driving ranges (80-150 km) resulting in a large fraction (greater than 75%) of the energy to power the vehicle being grid electricity. 4) Mild hybrid-electric vehicles (MHEVs) can be designed using ultracapacitors having an energy storage capacity of 75-150 Wh. The fuel economy improvement with the ultracapacitors is 10%-15% higher than with the same weight of batteries due to the higher efficiency of the ultracapacitors and more efficient engine operation. 5) Hybrid-electric vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells can use either batteries or ultracapacitors for energy storage. Simulation results indicate the equivalent fuel economy of the fuel cell powered vehicles is 2-3 times higher than that of a gasoline fueled IC vehicle of the same weight and road load. Compared to an engine-powered HEV, the equivalent fuel economy of the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle wou- - ld be 1.66-2.0 times higher

The analytical approach is based on the energy balance equations, whereas the simulation approach is based on an accurate and fast forward-facing simulation model for simulating parallel and series hybrid powertrains. A very good agreement between simulation and analytical results gives confidence pertaining to the accuracy of the performed analysis and confirms the validity of the analytical framework. Thus, combined simulation and analytical analysis enables deep insight into the energy conversion phenomena in hybrid powertrains and reveals the advantages and disadvantages of both hybrid concepts running under different operating conditions. It is obvious from the presented results that the parallel hybrid powertrain features better fuel economy than the series one for the applied test cycles, whereas both hybrid powertrain concepts feature the best fuel economy at light-duty application.

Designing a hybrid drive train is a multiobjective design problem. The main design objectives are fuel consumption, emissions, and performance. However, it is difficult to find a global optimal integral design solution due to the interdependence of design choices (parameters) regarding the drive-train topology, component sizes, component technologies, and control strategy, as well as the unknown sensitivity of the design objectives to the design parameters. In this paper, a parametric optimization procedure is presented to solve the design problem, where the main design objective is fuel consumption. The effects of parameter variation on fuel consumption have been investigated. Furthermore, a reduced hybrid drive-train model is introduced, with which the effects of design parameter variation is very quickly studied with an average error of less than 1.6%.

Now, several auto manufacturers are preparing for the commercial launches of battery powered electric vehicles in 2011. Another battle for dominance in electric car market has started. However, the development of technologies for electric cars has a very long history and presently there is a huge diversity of technological solutions in development. In order to understand the evolution of electric vehicles, we carried out two related case studies. In the first case study, we analyze the experience of General Motors in the last 40 years in developing electric vehicles. Our focuses are on the objectives of each development, technologies employed and external factors that stimulated each effort. The results show that in the first 20 years the main objective is to explore different technologies. The intention to launch a commercial electric vehicle only appears in the last 20 years. In the second case study, we analyze propulsion technologies and product architectures electric vehicles announced, in the last few years, by established auto manufacturers and new entrants.

D, [2015-07-23T20:27:38.692911 #11473] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper focuses on the intrinsic aspects of power management for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in HEVs (PHEV). A vehicle power distribution density function is used to describe the drive cycle characteristics. An electric driveline loss is introduced to describe the minimum system loss for a given mechanical power output, and a piecewise linear fuel consumption model is used to capture essential characteristics such as idle fuel consumption rate, peak efficiency, and the minimum power to reach peak efficiency. Models are based on the assumption that both machines operate at the optimal speed and torque for a given mechanical power as if they are coupled with an ideal continuous variable transmission (CVT). The power management strategy is represented with a pair of power parameters that describe the power threshold for turning on the engine and the optimum battery power in engine-on operations. The model of a parallel hybrid electric powertrain is constructed to obtain optimal solutions that maximize the fuel economy for a given battery energy depletion and for a general vehicle power distribution density function. One-dimensional loss models of two power sources as approximations to real machines coupled with hypothetic CVTs are introduced to solve the optimization problem analytically. It is found that the optimal minimum engine power is the controlling factor in minimizing the total fuel consumption for the given battery energy depletion targets and that the optimal power is solely determined by powertrain characteristics. Numerical simulations validated the properties of the optimal power solutions obtained through analytic approaches. The significance of the results to real-world HEV and PHEV applications are also discussed.

Design of the drive train components for the desired performance of the vehicle no longer based on different formulae. Fuel economy and emission have become the basic constraint. Automaker has to take care of the road transport policies also before deciding the sizes of the drive train components. Modeling and simulation based design method has been adopted by many researchers and automakers. The sizes of drive train components are optimized for the desired performance of vehicle. NERL ADVISOR is one such vehicle simulation software which is used for sizing of the drive train components of HEV. This paper uses simulation on ADVISOR to size the drive train components of hybrid Electric Vehicle for the desired performance.

D, [2015-07-23T20:27:38.711697 #11473] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Beginning in 1990, the major automotive passenger vehicle manufacturers once again re-evaluated the potential of the battery powered electric vehicle (EV). This intensive effort to reduce the battery EV to commercial practice focused attention on the key issue of limited vehicle range, resulting from the low energy density and high mass characteristics of batteries, in comparison to the high energy density of liquid hydrocarbon (HC) fuels. Consequently, by 1995, vehicle manufacturers turned their attention to hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). This redirection of EV effort was highlighted finally in 1997, at the 57th Frankfurt Motor Show, the Audi Duo parallel type hybrid was released for the domestic market as a 1998 model vehicle. Also at the 1997 32nd Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota Hybrid System (THS) Prius was released for the domestic market as a production 1998 model vehicle. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the key features of these two 1998 model year production hybrid systems. Among the conclusions, two issues are evident: one, the major manufacturers have turned to the hybrid concept in their search for solutions to the key EV issues of limited range; and, heating/air conditioning; and two, the focus is now on introducing hybrid EV for test marketing domestically

D, [2015-07-23T20:27:38.715310 #11473] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Four light duty gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles (Toyota Prius, Honda Civic, Honda Insight and Ford Escape) were tested over five different driving cycles at two temperatures using chassis dynamometer emissions testing procedures. The vehicles were tested at 20degC and -18degC. Second-by-second gaseous emissions and total particle number emissions from the hybrid vehicles show patterns that are in some ways similar to conventional multiport fuel injected gasoline vehicles, with large increases in concentration on accelerations. Under driving conditions where the engine may be turned off and on, or under conditions where the electric drive assists in accelerations, different patterns are observed. These patterns can also differ from one repeat of a driving cycle to another, depending on the state of charge of the battery. Cold temperature operation is very demanding on the electric system of the hybrids. The batteries are challenged not only in starting the vehicle but in retaining charge during operation. These conditions result in much higher fuel consumption and mass emission rates of pollutants and greenhouse gases as compared to standard temperature operation and also greatly influence the transient nature of emissions from these vehicles.

The test bench, which is implemented using relatively low-cost off-the-shelf products, is capable of serving a broad variety of purposes ranging from the design and test of propulsion motor drives to the implementation of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) powertrain control strategies. This paper illustrates the test bench capabilities by (a) simulating the Jeep Commander II, a fuel cell sport utility vehicle (SUV) from Daimler-Chrysler, performing the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS), (b) simulating the Prius, a commercially available gasoline-electric hybrid compact car from Toyota, performing the Japanese "10-15 mode" driving schedule, and (c) determining the efficiency map of a three-phase induction motor (IM). Additionally, the test bench could be also used as a dynamic simulator for renewable energy sources such as wind turbine generators.

D, [2015-07-23T20:27:38.727023 #11473] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper addresses system design and integration challenges involved in meeting the requirements for coordinated deployment of Intelligent Hybrid Vehicle Systems. A hybrid vehicle can run purely on a gas engine, purely on an electric motor, or a combination of both. Advanced hybrid vehicles are designed to use a vehicle management system that integrates many subsystem functions into one system. However, many recent hybrid vehicles do not focus on the utilization of decision support techniques for the implementation of system design. The decision support design emphasizes a driver-oriented and automatic-oriented drive-by-wire vehicle system. The top-down functional decomposition and bottom-up physical integration design methodologies help to create an augmented functional analysis in the device level software. The significant portions are devoted to introducing the design stages and establishing the hybrid vehicle management system.

Pulse width modulation (PWM) control methods are examined for operating such a plug-in HEV in mobile power generation and vehicle-to-grid support applications to assess their impacts on the power conversion efficiency. A novel unipolar/interleaved PWM switching scheme is proposed, which can significantly reduce the switching losses and substantially increase the efficiency. A dual inverter drive prototype was assembled to test the PWM control schemes and test results are included to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

The idea is to utilize the already available main traction and auxiliary motors and associated power electronics systems of an HEV to construct the charger circuit instead of building a standalone charger. Compared to the latter, it enables significant cost, weight, and volume reductions. The topology was verified by modeling and experimental results on a 14 kW prototype.

D, [2015-07-23T20:27:38.740859 #11473] DEBUG -- : Abstract: A `Gasoline-Electric Hybrid Engine Vehicle' is a vehicle which works on electrical poweras well as fuel like petrol. It has many benefits over its predecessors, which developed power using only fuel. The thought is to design and construct a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) powered by battery as well as petrol. The vehicle is made dynamic in nature by making use of electrical power from battery and fuel power. It consumes less fuel and creates comparatively less pollution as compared to conventional vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles consists of a battery, to drive the electric motor and power system with an IC engine to increase fuel economy reduce harmful emissions from the exhaust. Also there is a provision for recharging the battery using a generator which is run using a turbine, which runs on the exhaust of the IC engine. In HEV, the battery single handedly provides power for driving at low speeds where the efficiency of IC engine is least. In cruising and high load conditions like moving up the hill, the electric power assists the engine by providing additional power. Thus the HEV is the best alternative in areas with high traffic like urban metropolitan cities.

Two operating objectives are identified, one for energy saving and the other for substituting petroleum fuel by electrical energy. The way in which the power train control and component rating can be optimised to meet these particular operating objectives is discussed. In the final part of the paper the performance of the optimised hybrid vehicles are compared with both IC engine and electric vehicles and the petroleum substitution design is shown to warrant further development.

D, [2015-07-23T20:27:38.754874 #11473] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Assuming the availability of a high energy and power density battery of 100 Wh/lb and 100 W/lb by the 1980' s, the energy consumption and efficiency of electric and heat engine cars are compared on an equal basis. This is achieved by considering a reference electric car of 3150-lb weight similar in body construction, aerodynamics, and rolling resistance to a conventional heat engine car of equal weight, and comparing the performance of the two cars over the same driving modes. The reference electric car is then used as a baseline to evaluate the possible improvements in future electric cars. The energy consumption for an optimized 2000-lb electric car of driving range, comfort, and performance comparable to a conventional car is estimated. Assuming a gradual growth in electric car population leading to their widespread use by the 1990's, the impact on electric power generation and distribution systems is estimated. Though the analysis is based on a high energy and power density battery the results may be extrapolated to electric cars using lower performance batteries. It is noted that batteries with lower energy density can provide sufficient driving range to fulfill a significant portion of our transportation needs and their continued development and improvement will accelerate the achievement of the high energy-density goal [1].

D, [2015-07-23T20:27:38.768399 #11473] DEBUG -- : Abstract: The application of batteries and ultracapacitors in electric energy storage units for battery powered (EV) and charge sustaining and plug-in hybrid-electric (HEV and PHEV) vehicles have been studied in detail. The use of IC engines and hydrogen fuel cells as the primary energy converters for the hybrid vehicles was considered. The study focused on the use of lithium-ion batteries and carbon/carbon ultracapacitors as the energy storage technologies most likely to be used in future vehicles. The key findings of the study are as follows. 1) The energy density and power density characteristics of both battery and ultracapacitor technologies are sufficient for the design of attractive EVs, HEVs, and PHEVs. 2) Charge sustaining, engine powered hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) can be designed using either batteries or ultracapacitors with fuel economy improvements of 50% and greater. 3) Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) can be designed with effective all-electric ranges of 30-60 km using lithium-ion batteries that are relatively small. The effective fuel economy of the PHEVs can be very high (greater than 100 mpg) for long daily driving ranges (80-150 km) resulting in a large fraction (greater than 75%) of the energy to power the vehicle being grid electricity. 4) Mild hybrid-electric vehicles (MHEVs) can be designed using ultracapacitors having an energy storage capacity of 75-150 Wh. The fuel economy improvement with the ultracapacitors is 10%-15% higher than with the same weight of batteries due to the higher efficiency of the ultracapacitors and more efficient engine operation. 5) Hybrid-electric vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells can use either batteries or ultracapacitors for energy storage. Simulation results indicate the equivalent fuel economy of the fuel cell powered vehicles is 2-3 times higher than that of a gasoline fueled IC vehicle of the same weight and road load. Compared to an engine-powered HEV, the equivalent fuel economy of the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle wou- - ld be 1.66-2.0 times higher

The analytical approach is based on the energy balance equations, whereas the simulation approach is based on an accurate and fast forward-facing simulation model for simulating parallel and series hybrid powertrains. A very good agreement between simulation and analytical results gives confidence pertaining to the accuracy of the performed analysis and confirms the validity of the analytical framework. Thus, combined simulation and analytical analysis enables deep insight into the energy conversion phenomena in hybrid powertrains and reveals the advantages and disadvantages of both hybrid concepts running under different operating conditions. It is obvious from the presented results that the parallel hybrid powertrain features better fuel economy than the series one for the applied test cycles, whereas both hybrid powertrain concepts feature the best fuel economy at light-duty application.

Designing a hybrid drive train is a multiobjective design problem. The main design objectives are fuel consumption, emissions, and performance. However, it is difficult to find a global optimal integral design solution due to the interdependence of design choices (parameters) regarding the drive-train topology, component sizes, component technologies, and control strategy, as well as the unknown sensitivity of the design objectives to the design parameters. In this paper, a parametric optimization procedure is presented to solve the design problem, where the main design objective is fuel consumption. The effects of parameter variation on fuel consumption have been investigated. Furthermore, a reduced hybrid drive-train model is introduced, with which the effects of design parameter variation is very quickly studied with an average error of less than 1.6%.

D, [2015-07-23T20:27:38.777689 #11473] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Toyota is the pioneer in the hybrid electric vehicle, and today almost all major car assemblers produce hybrid cars. Now, several auto manufacturers are preparing for the commercial launches of battery powered electric vehicles in 2011. Another battle for dominance in electric car market has started. However, the development of technologies for electric cars has a very long history and presently there is a huge diversity of technological solutions in development. In order to understand the evolution of electric vehicles, we carried out two related case studies. In the first case study, we analyze the experience of General Motors in the last 40 years in developing electric vehicles. Our focuses are on the objectives of each development, technologies employed and external factors that stimulated each effort. The results show that in the first 20 years the main objective is to explore different technologies. The intention to launch a commercial electric vehicle only appears in the last 20 years. In the second case study, we analyze propulsion technologies and product architectures electric vehicles announced, in the last few years, by established auto manufacturers and new entrants. The results show that innovations in product architecture can provide a niche market for electric vehicles.

D, [2015-07-23T20:29:39.762278 #11571] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper focuses on the intrinsic aspects of power management for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in HEVs (PHEV). A vehicle power distribution density function is used to describe the drive cycle characteristics. An electric driveline loss is introduced to describe the minimum system loss for a given mechanical power output, and a piecewise linear fuel consumption model is used to capture essential characteristics such as idle fuel consumption rate, peak efficiency, and the minimum power to reach peak efficiency. Models are based on the assumption that both machines operate at the optimal speed and torque for a given mechanical power as if they are coupled with an ideal continuous variable transmission (CVT). The power management strategy is represented with a pair of power parameters that describe the power threshold for turning on the engine and the optimum battery power in engine-on operations. The model of a parallel hybrid electric powertrain is constructed to obtain optimal solutions that maximize the fuel economy for a given battery energy depletion and for a general vehicle power distribution density function. One-dimensional loss models of two power sources as approximations to real machines coupled with hypothetic CVTs are introduced to solve the optimization problem analytically. It is found that the optimal minimum engine power is the controlling factor in minimizing the total fuel consumption for the given battery energy depletion targets and that the optimal power is solely determined by powertrain characteristics. Numerical simulations validated the properties of the optimal power solutions obtained through analytic approaches. The significance of the results to real-world HEV and PHEV applications are also discussed.

Design of the drive train components for the desired performance of the vehicle no longer based on different formulae. Fuel economy and emission have become the basic constraint. Automaker has to take care of the road transport policies also before deciding the sizes of the drive train components. Modeling and simulation based design method has been adopted by many researchers and automakers. The sizes of drive train components are optimized for the desired performance of vehicle. NERL ADVISOR is one such vehicle simulation software which is used for sizing of the drive train components of HEV. This paper uses simulation on ADVISOR to size the drive train components of hybrid Electric Vehicle for the desired performance.

D, [2015-07-23T20:29:40.041943 #11571] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Beginning in 1990, the major automotive passenger vehicle manufacturers once again re-evaluated the potential of the battery powered electric vehicle (EV). This intensive effort to reduce the battery EV to commercial practice focused attention on the key issue of limited vehicle range, resulting from the low energy density and high mass characteristics of batteries, in comparison to the high energy density of liquid hydrocarbon (HC) fuels. Consequently, by 1995, vehicle manufacturers turned their attention to hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). This redirection of EV effort was highlighted finally in 1997, at the 57th Frankfurt Motor Show, the Audi Duo parallel type hybrid was released for the domestic market as a 1998 model vehicle. Also at the 1997 32nd Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota Hybrid System (THS) Prius was released for the domestic market as a production 1998 model vehicle. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the key features of these two 1998 model year production hybrid systems. Among the conclusions, two issues are evident: one, the major manufacturers have turned to the hybrid concept in their search for solutions to the key EV issues of limited range; and, heating/air conditioning; and two, the focus is now on introducing hybrid EV for test marketing domestically

D, [2015-07-23T20:29:40.186898 #11571] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Four light duty gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles (Toyota Prius, Honda Civic, Honda Insight and Ford Escape) were tested over five different driving cycles at two temperatures using chassis dynamometer emissions testing procedures. The vehicles were tested at 20degC and -18degC. Second-by-second gaseous emissions and total particle number emissions from the hybrid vehicles show patterns that are in some ways similar to conventional multiport fuel injected gasoline vehicles, with large increases in concentration on accelerations. Under driving conditions where the engine may be turned off and on, or under conditions where the electric drive assists in accelerations, different patterns are observed. These patterns can also differ from one repeat of a driving cycle to another, depending on the state of charge of the battery. Cold temperature operation is very demanding on the electric system of the hybrids. The batteries are challenged not only in starting the vehicle but in retaining charge during operation. These conditions result in much higher fuel consumption and mass emission rates of pollutants and greenhouse gases as compared to standard temperature operation and also greatly influence the transient nature of emissions from these vehicles.

The test bench, which is implemented using relatively low-cost off-the-shelf products, is capable of serving a broad variety of purposes ranging from the design and test of propulsion motor drives to the implementation of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) powertrain control strategies. This paper illustrates the test bench capabilities by (a) simulating the Jeep Commander II, a fuel cell sport utility vehicle (SUV) from Daimler-Chrysler, performing the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS), (b) simulating the Prius, a commercially available gasoline-electric hybrid compact car from Toyota, performing the Japanese "10-15 mode" driving schedule, and (c) determining the efficiency map of a three-phase induction motor (IM). Additionally, the test bench could be also used as a dynamic simulator for renewable energy sources such as wind turbine generators.

D, [2015-07-23T20:29:40.676663 #11571] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper addresses system design and integration challenges involved in meeting the requirements for coordinated deployment of Intelligent Hybrid Vehicle Systems. A hybrid vehicle can run purely on a gas engine, purely on an electric motor, or a combination of both. Advanced hybrid vehicles are designed to use a vehicle management system that integrates many subsystem functions into one system. However, many recent hybrid vehicles do not focus on the utilization of decision support techniques for the implementation of system design. The decision support design emphasizes a driver-oriented and automatic-oriented drive-by-wire vehicle system. The top-down functional decomposition and bottom-up physical integration design methodologies help to create an augmented functional analysis in the device level software. The significant portions are devoted to introducing the design stages and establishing the hybrid vehicle management system.

D, [2015-07-23T20:29:41.011415 #11571] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Racecar performance, even on a collegiate or student level, depends on a multitude of factors, some of which are incidental to the track the race will be run upon. A careful balance of power, speed, and control needs to be maintained in order to optimize a vehicle's performance on the racetrack. As UC Irvine's entry into the 2012 Energy Invitational race, Gamma has been a testbed for different drive technologies at some point in time, and is now being used to investigate the effects of active torque bias on vehicle handling under racing conditions.

The idea is to utilize the already available main traction and auxiliary motors and associated power electronics systems of an HEV to construct the charger circuit instead of building a standalone charger. Compared to the latter, it enables significant cost, weight, and volume reductions. The topology was verified by modeling and experimental results on a 14 kW prototype.

D, [2015-07-23T20:29:41.278765 #11571] DEBUG -- : Abstract: A `Gasoline-Electric Hybrid Engine Vehicle' is a vehicle which works on electrical poweras well as fuel like petrol. It has many benefits over its predecessors, which developed power using only fuel. The thought is to design and construct a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) powered by battery as well as petrol. The vehicle is made dynamic in nature by making use of electrical power from battery and fuel power. It consumes less fuel and creates comparatively less pollution as compared to conventional vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles consists of a battery, to drive the electric motor and power system with an IC engine to increase fuel economy reduce harmful emissions from the exhaust. Also there is a provision for recharging the battery using a generator which is run using a turbine, which runs on the exhaust of the IC engine. In HEV, the battery single handedly provides power for driving at low speeds where the efficiency of IC engine is least. In cruising and high load conditions like moving up the hill, the electric power assists the engine by providing additional power. Thus the HEV is the best alternative in areas with high traffic like urban metropolitan cities.

The way in which the power train control and component rating can be optimised to meet these particular operating objectives is discussed. In the final part of the paper the performance of the optimised hybrid vehicles are compared with both IC engine and electric vehicles and the petroleum substitution design is shown to warrant further development.

This is achieved by considering a reference electric car of 3150-lb weight similar in body construction, aerodynamics, and rolling resistance to a conventional heat engine car of equal weight, and comparing the performance of the two cars over the same driving modes. The reference electric car is then used as a baseline to evaluate the possible improvements in future electric cars. The energy consumption for an optimized 2000-lb electric car of driving range, comfort, and performance comparable to a conventional car is estimated. Assuming a gradual growth in electric car population leading to their widespread use by the 1990's, the impact on electric power generation and distribution systems is estimated. Though the analysis is based on a high energy and power density battery the results may be extrapolated to electric cars using lower performance batteries. It is noted that batteries with lower energy density can provide sufficient driving range to fulfill a significant portion of our transportation needs and their continued development and improvement will accelerate the achievement of the high energy-density goal [1].

D, [2015-07-23T20:29:42.627733 #11571] DEBUG -- : Abstract: The application of batteries and ultracapacitors in electric energy storage units for battery powered (EV) and charge sustaining and plug-in hybrid-electric (HEV and PHEV) vehicles have been studied in detail. The use of IC engines and hydrogen fuel cells as the primary energy converters for the hybrid vehicles was considered. The study focused on the use of lithium-ion batteries and carbon/carbon ultracapacitors as the energy storage technologies most likely to be used in future vehicles. The key findings of the study are as follows. 1) The energy density and power density characteristics of both battery and ultracapacitor technologies are sufficient for the design of attractive EVs, HEVs, and PHEVs. 2) Charge sustaining, engine powered hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) can be designed using either batteries or ultracapacitors with fuel economy improvements of 50% and greater. 3) Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) can be designed with effective all-electric ranges of 30-60 km using lithium-ion batteries that are relatively small. The effective fuel economy of the PHEVs can be very high (greater than 100 mpg) for long daily driving ranges (80-150 km) resulting in a large fraction (greater than 75%) of the energy to power the vehicle being grid electricity. 4) Mild hybrid-electric vehicles (MHEVs) can be designed using ultracapacitors having an energy storage capacity of 75-150 Wh. The fuel economy improvement with the ultracapacitors is 10%-15% higher than with the same weight of batteries due to the higher efficiency of the ultracapacitors and more efficient engine operation. 5) Hybrid-electric vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells can use either batteries or ultracapacitors for energy storage. Simulation results indicate the equivalent fuel economy of the fuel cell powered vehicles is 2-3 times higher than that of a gasoline fueled IC vehicle of the same weight and road load. Compared to an engine-powered HEV, the equivalent fuel economy of the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle wou- - ld be 1.66-2.0 times higher

D, [2015-07-23T20:29:42.838999 #11571] DEBUG -- : Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present a simulation and analytical analysis of the energy conversion efficiency in parallel and series hybrid powertrains. The analytical approach is based on the energy balance equations, whereas the simulation approach is based on an accurate and fast forward-facing simulation model for simulating parallel and series hybrid powertrains. A very good agreement between simulation and analytical results gives confidence pertaining to the accuracy of the performed analysis and confirms the validity of the analytical framework. Thus, combined simulation and analytical analysis enables deep insight into the energy conversion phenomena in hybrid powertrains and reveals the advantages and disadvantages of both hybrid concepts running under different operating conditions. It is obvious from the presented results that the parallel hybrid powertrain features better fuel economy than the series one for the applied test cycles, whereas both hybrid powertrain concepts feature the best fuel economy at light-duty application.

Designing a hybrid drive train is a multiobjective design problem. The main design objectives are fuel consumption, emissions, and performance. However, it is difficult to find a global optimal integral design solution due to the interdependence of design choices (parameters) regarding the drive-train topology, component sizes, component technologies, and control strategy, as well as the unknown sensitivity of the design objectives to the design parameters. In this paper, a parametric optimization procedure is presented to solve the design problem, where the main design objective is fuel consumption. The effects of parameter variation on fuel consumption have been investigated. Furthermore, a reduced hybrid drive-train model is introduced, with which the effects of design parameter variation is very quickly studied with an average error of less than 1.6%.

Now, several auto manufacturers are preparing for the commercial launches of battery powered electric vehicles in 2011. Another battle for dominance in electric car market has started. However, the development of technologies for electric cars has a very long history and presently there is a huge diversity of technological solutions in development. In order to understand the evolution of electric vehicles, we carried out two related case studies. In the first case study, we analyze the experience of General Motors in the last 40 years in developing electric vehicles. Our focuses are on the objectives of each development, technologies employed and external factors that stimulated each effort. The results show that in the first 20 years the main objective is to explore different technologies. The intention to launch a commercial electric vehicle only appears in the last 20 years. In the second case study, we analyze propulsion technologies and product architectures electric vehicles announced, in the last few years, by established auto manufacturers and new entrants. The results show that innovations in product architecture can provide a niche market for electric vehicles.

D, [2015-07-23T20:31:35.571496 #11618] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper focuses on the intrinsic aspects of power management for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in HEVs (PHEV). A vehicle power distribution density function is used to describe the drive cycle characteristics. An electric driveline loss is introduced to describe the minimum system loss for a given mechanical power output, and a piecewise linear fuel consumption model is used to capture essential characteristics such as idle fuel consumption rate, peak efficiency, and the minimum power to reach peak efficiency. Models are based on the assumption that both machines operate at the optimal speed and torque for a given mechanical power as if they are coupled with an ideal continuous variable transmission (CVT). The power management strategy is represented with a pair of power parameters that describe the power threshold for turning on the engine and the optimum battery power in engine-on operations. The model of a parallel hybrid electric powertrain is constructed to obtain optimal solutions that maximize the fuel economy for a given battery energy depletion and for a general vehicle power distribution density function. One-dimensional loss models of two power sources as approximations to real machines coupled with hypothetic CVTs are introduced to solve the optimization problem analytically. It is found that the optimal minimum engine power is the controlling factor in minimizing the total fuel consumption for the given battery energy depletion targets and that the optimal power is solely determined by powertrain characteristics. Numerical simulations validated the properties of the optimal power solutions obtained through analytic approaches. The significance of the results to real-world HEV and PHEV applications are also discussed.

Design of the drive train components for the desired performance of the vehicle no longer based on different formulae. Fuel economy and emission have become the basic constraint. Automaker has to take care of the road transport policies also before deciding the sizes of the drive train components. Modeling and simulation based design method has been adopted by many researchers and automakers. The sizes of drive train components are optimized for the desired performance of vehicle. NERL ADVISOR is one such vehicle simulation software which is used for sizing of the drive train components of HEV. This paper uses simulation on ADVISOR to size the drive train components of hybrid Electric Vehicle for the desired performance.

D, [2015-07-23T20:31:35.883104 #11618] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Beginning in 1990, the major automotive passenger vehicle manufacturers once again re-evaluated the potential of the battery powered electric vehicle (EV). This intensive effort to reduce the battery EV to commercial practice focused attention on the key issue of limited vehicle range, resulting from the low energy density and high mass characteristics of batteries, in comparison to the high energy density of liquid hydrocarbon (HC) fuels. Consequently, by 1995, vehicle manufacturers turned their attention to hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). This redirection of EV effort was highlighted finally in 1997, at the 57th Frankfurt Motor Show, the Audi Duo parallel type hybrid was released for the domestic market as a 1998 model vehicle. Also at the 1997 32nd Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota Hybrid System (THS) Prius was released for the domestic market as a production 1998 model vehicle. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the key features of these two 1998 model year production hybrid systems. Among the conclusions, two issues are evident: one, the major manufacturers have turned to the hybrid concept in their search for solutions to the key EV issues of limited range; and, heating/air conditioning; and two, the focus is now on introducing hybrid EV for test marketing domestically

D, [2015-07-23T20:31:36.027934 #11618] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Four light duty gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles (Toyota Prius, Honda Civic, Honda Insight and Ford Escape) were tested over five different driving cycles at two temperatures using chassis dynamometer emissions testing procedures. The vehicles were tested at 20degC and -18degC. Second-by-second gaseous emissions and total particle number emissions from the hybrid vehicles show patterns that are in some ways similar to conventional multiport fuel injected gasoline vehicles, with large increases in concentration on accelerations. Under driving conditions where the engine may be turned off and on, or under conditions where the electric drive assists in accelerations, different patterns are observed. These patterns can also differ from one repeat of a driving cycle to another, depending on the state of charge of the battery. Cold temperature operation is very demanding on the electric system of the hybrids. The batteries are challenged not only in starting the vehicle but in retaining charge during operation. These conditions result in much higher fuel consumption and mass emission rates of pollutants and greenhouse gases as compared to standard temperature operation and also greatly influence the transient nature of emissions from these vehicles.

The test bench, which is implemented using relatively low-cost off-the-shelf products, is capable of serving a broad variety of purposes ranging from the design and test of propulsion motor drives to the implementation of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) powertrain control strategies. This paper illustrates the test bench capabilities by (a) simulating the Jeep Commander II, a fuel cell sport utility vehicle (SUV) from Daimler-Chrysler, performing the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS), (b) simulating the Prius, a commercially available gasoline-electric hybrid compact car from Toyota, performing the Japanese "10-15 mode" driving schedule, and (c) determining the efficiency map of a three-phase induction motor (IM). Additionally, the test bench could be also used as a dynamic simulator for renewable energy sources such as wind turbine generators.

D, [2015-07-23T20:31:36.518543 #11618] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper addresses system design and integration challenges involved in meeting the requirements for coordinated deployment of Intelligent Hybrid Vehicle Systems. A hybrid vehicle can run purely on a gas engine, purely on an electric motor, or a combination of both. Advanced hybrid vehicles are designed to use a vehicle management system that integrates many subsystem functions into one system. However, many recent hybrid vehicles do not focus on the utilization of decision support techniques for the implementation of system design. The decision support design emphasizes a driver-oriented and automatic-oriented drive-by-wire vehicle system. The top-down functional decomposition and bottom-up physical integration design methodologies help to create an augmented functional analysis in the device level software. The significant portions are devoted to introducing the design stages and establishing the hybrid vehicle management system.

Pulse width modulation (PWM) control methods are examined for operating such a plug-in HEV in mobile power generation and vehicle-to-grid support applications to assess their impacts on the power conversion efficiency. A novel unipolar/interleaved PWM switching scheme is proposed, which can significantly reduce the switching losses and substantially increase the efficiency. A dual inverter drive prototype was assembled to test the PWM control schemes and test results are included to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

A careful balance of power, speed, and control needs to be maintained in order to optimize a vehicle's performance on the racetrack. As UC Irvine's entry into the 2012 Energy Invitational race, Gamma has been a testbed for different drive technologies at some point in time, and is now being used to investigate the effects of active torque bias on vehicle handling under racing conditions.

The idea is to utilize the already available main traction and auxiliary motors and associated power electronics systems of an HEV to construct the charger circuit instead of building a standalone charger. Compared to the latter, it enables significant cost, weight, and volume reductions. The topology was verified by modeling and experimental results on a 14 kW prototype.

D, [2015-07-23T20:31:37.053065 #11618] DEBUG -- : Abstract: A `Gasoline-Electric Hybrid Engine Vehicle' is a vehicle which works on electrical poweras well as fuel like petrol. It has many benefits over its predecessors, which developed power using only fuel. The thought is to design and construct a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) powered by battery as well as petrol. The vehicle is made dynamic in nature by making use of electrical power from battery and fuel power. It consumes less fuel and creates comparatively less pollution as compared to conventional vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles consists of a battery, to drive the electric motor and power system with an IC engine to increase fuel economy reduce harmful emissions from the exhaust. Also there is a provision for recharging the battery using a generator which is run using a turbine, which runs on the exhaust of the IC engine. In HEV, the battery single handedly provides power for driving at low speeds where the efficiency of IC engine is least. In cruising and high load conditions like moving up the hill, the electric power assists the engine by providing additional power. Thus the HEV is the best alternative in areas with high traffic like urban metropolitan cities.

The way in which the power train control and component rating can be optimised to meet these particular operating objectives is discussed. In the final part of the paper the performance of the optimised hybrid vehicles are compared with both IC engine and electric vehicles and the petroleum substitution design is shown to warrant further development.

This is achieved by considering a reference electric car of 3150-lb weight similar in body construction, aerodynamics, and rolling resistance to a conventional heat engine car of equal weight, and comparing the performance of the two cars over the same driving modes. The reference electric car is then used as a baseline to evaluate the possible improvements in future electric cars. The energy consumption for an optimized 2000-lb electric car of driving range, comfort, and performance comparable to a conventional car is estimated. Assuming a gradual growth in electric car population leading to their widespread use by the 1990's, the impact on electric power generation and distribution systems is estimated. Though the analysis is based on a high energy and power density battery the results may be extrapolated to electric cars using lower performance batteries. It is noted that batteries with lower energy density can provide sufficient driving range to fulfill a significant portion of our transportation needs and their continued development and improvement will accelerate the achievement of the high energy-density goal [1].

D, [2015-07-23T20:31:38.532586 #11618] DEBUG -- : Abstract: The application of batteries and ultracapacitors in electric energy storage units for battery powered (EV) and charge sustaining and plug-in hybrid-electric (HEV and PHEV) vehicles have been studied in detail. The use of IC engines and hydrogen fuel cells as the primary energy converters for the hybrid vehicles was considered. The study focused on the use of lithium-ion batteries and carbon/carbon ultracapacitors as the energy storage technologies most likely to be used in future vehicles. The key findings of the study are as follows. 1) The energy density and power density characteristics of both battery and ultracapacitor technologies are sufficient for the design of attractive EVs, HEVs, and PHEVs. 2) Charge sustaining, engine powered hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) can be designed using either batteries or ultracapacitors with fuel economy improvements of 50% and greater. 3) Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) can be designed with effective all-electric ranges of 30-60 km using lithium-ion batteries that are relatively small. The effective fuel economy of the PHEVs can be very high (greater than 100 mpg) for long daily driving ranges (80-150 km) resulting in a large fraction (greater than 75%) of the energy to power the vehicle being grid electricity. 4) Mild hybrid-electric vehicles (MHEVs) can be designed using ultracapacitors having an energy storage capacity of 75-150 Wh. The fuel economy improvement with the ultracapacitors is 10%-15% higher than with the same weight of batteries due to the higher efficiency of the ultracapacitors and more efficient engine operation. 5) Hybrid-electric vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells can use either batteries or ultracapacitors for energy storage. Simulation results indicate the equivalent fuel economy of the fuel cell powered vehicles is 2-3 times higher than that of a gasoline fueled IC vehicle of the same weight and road load. Compared to an engine-powered HEV, the equivalent fuel economy of the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle wou- - ld be 1.66-2.0 times higher

The analytical approach is based on the energy balance equations, whereas the simulation approach is based on an accurate and fast forward-facing simulation model for simulating parallel and series hybrid powertrains. A very good agreement between simulation and analytical results gives confidence pertaining to the accuracy of the performed analysis and confirms the validity of the analytical framework. Thus, combined simulation and analytical analysis enables deep insight into the energy conversion phenomena in hybrid powertrains and reveals the advantages and disadvantages of both hybrid concepts running under different operating conditions. It is obvious from the presented results that the parallel hybrid powertrain features better fuel economy than the series one for the applied test cycles, whereas both hybrid powertrain concepts feature the best fuel economy at light-duty application.

Designing a hybrid drive train is a multiobjective design problem. The main design objectives are fuel consumption, emissions, and performance. However, it is difficult to find a global optimal integral design solution due to the interdependence of design choices (parameters) regarding the drive-train topology, component sizes, component technologies, and control strategy, as well as the unknown sensitivity of the design objectives to the design parameters. In this paper, a parametric optimization procedure is presented to solve the design problem, where the main design objective is fuel consumption. The effects of parameter variation on fuel consumption have been investigated. Furthermore, a reduced hybrid drive-train model is introduced, with which the effects of design parameter variation is very quickly studied with an average error of less than 1.6%.

Now, several auto manufacturers are preparing for the commercial launches of battery powered electric vehicles in 2011. Another battle for dominance in electric car market has started. However, the development of technologies for electric cars has a very long history and presently there is a huge diversity of technological solutions in development. In order to understand the evolution of electric vehicles, we carried out two related case studies. In the first case study, we analyze the experience of General Motors in the last 40 years in developing electric vehicles. Our focuses are on the objectives of each development, technologies employed and external factors that stimulated each effort. The results show that in the first 20 years the main objective is to explore different technologies. The intention to launch a commercial electric vehicle only appears in the last 20 years. In the second case study, we analyze propulsion technologies and product architectures electric vehicles announced, in the last few years, by established auto manufacturers and new entrants. The results show that innovations in product architecture can provide a niche market for electric vehicles.

D, [2015-07-23T21:01:13.772962 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper focuses on the intrinsic aspects of power management for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in HEVs (PHEV). A vehicle power distribution density function is used to describe the drive cycle characteristics. An electric driveline loss is introduced to describe the minimum system loss for a given mechanical power output, and a piecewise linear fuel consumption model is used to capture essential characteristics such as idle fuel consumption rate, peak efficiency, and the minimum power to reach peak efficiency. Models are based on the assumption that both machines operate at the optimal speed and torque for a given mechanical power as if they are coupled with an ideal continuous variable transmission (CVT). The power management strategy is represented with a pair of power parameters that describe the power threshold for turning on the engine and the optimum battery power in engine-on operations. The model of a parallel hybrid electric powertrain is constructed to obtain optimal solutions that maximize the fuel economy for a given battery energy depletion and for a general vehicle power distribution density function. One-dimensional loss models of two power sources as approximations to real machines coupled with hypothetic CVTs are introduced to solve the optimization problem analytically. It is found that the optimal minimum engine power is the controlling factor in minimizing the total fuel consumption for the given battery energy depletion targets and that the optimal power is solely determined by powertrain characteristics. Numerical simulations validated the properties of the optimal power solutions obtained through analytic approaches. The significance of the results to real-world HEV and PHEV applications are also discussed.

Design of the drive train components for the desired performance of the vehicle no longer based on different formulae. Fuel economy and emission have become the basic constraint. Automaker has to take care of the road transport policies also before deciding the sizes of the drive train components. Modeling and simulation based design method has been adopted by many researchers and automakers. The sizes of drive train components are optimized for the desired performance of vehicle. NERL ADVISOR is one such vehicle simulation software which is used for sizing of the drive train components of HEV. This paper uses simulation on ADVISOR to size the drive train components of hybrid Electric Vehicle for the desired performance.

D, [2015-07-23T21:01:14.042256 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Beginning in 1990, the major automotive passenger vehicle manufacturers once again re-evaluated the potential of the battery powered electric vehicle (EV). This intensive effort to reduce the battery EV to commercial practice focused attention on the key issue of limited vehicle range, resulting from the low energy density and high mass characteristics of batteries, in comparison to the high energy density of liquid hydrocarbon (HC) fuels. Consequently, by 1995, vehicle manufacturers turned their attention to hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). This redirection of EV effort was highlighted finally in 1997, at the 57th Frankfurt Motor Show, the Audi Duo parallel type hybrid was released for the domestic market as a 1998 model vehicle. Also at the 1997 32nd Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota Hybrid System (THS) Prius was released for the domestic market as a production 1998 model vehicle. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the key features of these two 1998 model year production hybrid systems. Among the conclusions, two issues are evident: one, the major manufacturers have turned to the hybrid concept in their search for solutions to the key EV issues of limited range; and, heating/air conditioning; and two, the focus is now on introducing hybrid EV for test marketing domestically

D, [2015-07-23T21:01:14.164974 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Four light duty gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles (Toyota Prius, Honda Civic, Honda Insight and Ford Escape) were tested over five different driving cycles at two temperatures using chassis dynamometer emissions testing procedures. The vehicles were tested at 20degC and -18degC. Second-by-second gaseous emissions and total particle number emissions from the hybrid vehicles show patterns that are in some ways similar to conventional multiport fuel injected gasoline vehicles, with large increases in concentration on accelerations. Under driving conditions where the engine may be turned off and on, or under conditions where the electric drive assists in accelerations, different patterns are observed. These patterns can also differ from one repeat of a driving cycle to another, depending on the state of charge of the battery. Cold temperature operation is very demanding on the electric system of the hybrids. The batteries are challenged not only in starting the vehicle but in retaining charge during operation. These conditions result in much higher fuel consumption and mass emission rates of pollutants and greenhouse gases as compared to standard temperature operation and also greatly influence the transient nature of emissions from these vehicles.

D, [2015-07-23T21:01:14.410417 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper describes the implementation of a flexible laboratory test bench for developing electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrains in a university environment. The test bench, which is implemented using relatively low-cost off-the-shelf products, is capable of serving a broad variety of purposes ranging from the design and test of propulsion motor drives to the implementation of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) powertrain control strategies. This paper illustrates the test bench capabilities by (a) simulating the Jeep Commander II, a fuel cell sport utility vehicle (SUV) from Daimler-Chrysler, performing the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS), (b) simulating the Prius, a commercially available gasoline-electric hybrid compact car from Toyota, performing the Japanese "10-15 mode" driving schedule, and (c) determining the efficiency map of a three-phase induction motor (IM). Additionally, the test bench could be also used as a dynamic simulator for renewable energy sources such as wind turbine generators.

D, [2015-07-23T21:01:14.577275 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper addresses system design and integration challenges involved in meeting the requirements for coordinated deployment of Intelligent Hybrid Vehicle Systems. A hybrid vehicle can run purely on a gas engine, purely on an electric motor, or a combination of both. Advanced hybrid vehicles are designed to use a vehicle management system that integrates many subsystem functions into one system. However, many recent hybrid vehicles do not focus on the utilization of decision support techniques for the implementation of system design. The decision support design emphasizes a driver-oriented and automatic-oriented drive-by-wire vehicle system. The top-down functional decomposition and bottom-up physical integration design methodologies help to create an augmented functional analysis in the device level software. The significant portions are devoted to introducing the design stages and establishing the hybrid vehicle management system.

Pulse width modulation (PWM) control methods are examined for operating such a plug-in HEV in mobile power generation and vehicle-to-grid support applications to assess their impacts on the power conversion efficiency. A novel unipolar/interleaved PWM switching scheme is proposed, which can significantly reduce the switching losses and substantially increase the efficiency. A dual inverter drive prototype was assembled to test the PWM control schemes and test results are included to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

Compared to the latter, it enables significant cost, weight, and volume reductions. The topology was verified by modeling and experimental results on a 14 kW prototype.

D, [2015-07-23T21:01:15.101665 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: A `Gasoline-Electric Hybrid Engine Vehicle' is a vehicle which works on electrical poweras well as fuel like petrol. It has many benefits over its predecessors, which developed power using only fuel. The thought is to design and construct a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) powered by battery as well as petrol. The vehicle is made dynamic in nature by making use of electrical power from battery and fuel power. It consumes less fuel and creates comparatively less pollution as compared to conventional vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles consists of a battery, to drive the electric motor and power system with an IC engine to increase fuel economy reduce harmful emissions from the exhaust. Also there is a provision for recharging the battery using a generator which is run using a turbine, which runs on the exhaust of the IC engine. In HEV, the battery single handedly provides power for driving at low speeds where the efficiency of IC engine is least. In cruising and high load conditions like moving up the hill, the electric power assists the engine by providing additional power. Thus the HEV is the best alternative in areas with high traffic like urban metropolitan cities.

The way in which the power train control and component rating can be optimised to meet these particular operating objectives is discussed. In the final part of the paper the performance of the optimised hybrid vehicles are compared with both IC engine and electric vehicles and the petroleum substitution design is shown to warrant further development.

This is achieved by considering a reference electric car of 3150-lb weight similar in body construction, aerodynamics, and rolling resistance to a conventional heat engine car of equal weight, and comparing the performance of the two cars over the same driving modes. The reference electric car is then used as a baseline to evaluate the possible improvements in future electric cars. The energy consumption for an optimized 2000-lb electric car of driving range, comfort, and performance comparable to a conventional car is estimated. Assuming a gradual growth in electric car population leading to their widespread use by the 1990's, the impact on electric power generation and distribution systems is estimated. Though the analysis is based on a high energy and power density battery the results may be extrapolated to electric cars using lower performance batteries. It is noted that batteries with lower energy density can provide sufficient driving range to fulfill a significant portion of our transportation needs and their continued development and improvement will accelerate the achievement of the high energy-density goal [1].

D, [2015-07-23T21:01:16.394640 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: The application of batteries and ultracapacitors in electric energy storage units for battery powered (EV) and charge sustaining and plug-in hybrid-electric (HEV and PHEV) vehicles have been studied in detail. The use of IC engines and hydrogen fuel cells as the primary energy converters for the hybrid vehicles was considered. The study focused on the use of lithium-ion batteries and carbon/carbon ultracapacitors as the energy storage technologies most likely to be used in future vehicles. The key findings of the study are as follows. 1) The energy density and power density characteristics of both battery and ultracapacitor technologies are sufficient for the design of attractive EVs, HEVs, and PHEVs. 2) Charge sustaining, engine powered hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) can be designed using either batteries or ultracapacitors with fuel economy improvements of 50% and greater. 3) Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) can be designed with effective all-electric ranges of 30-60 km using lithium-ion batteries that are relatively small. The effective fuel economy of the PHEVs can be very high (greater than 100 mpg) for long daily driving ranges (80-150 km) resulting in a large fraction (greater than 75%) of the energy to power the vehicle being grid electricity. 4) Mild hybrid-electric vehicles (MHEVs) can be designed using ultracapacitors having an energy storage capacity of 75-150 Wh. The fuel economy improvement with the ultracapacitors is 10%-15% higher than with the same weight of batteries due to the higher efficiency of the ultracapacitors and more efficient engine operation. 5) Hybrid-electric vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells can use either batteries or ultracapacitors for energy storage. Simulation results indicate the equivalent fuel economy of the fuel cell powered vehicles is 2-3 times higher than that of a gasoline fueled IC vehicle of the same weight and road load. Compared to an engine-powered HEV, the equivalent fuel economy of the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle wou- - ld be 1.66-2.0 times higher

The analytical approach is based on the energy balance equations, whereas the simulation approach is based on an accurate and fast forward-facing simulation model for simulating parallel and series hybrid powertrains. A very good agreement between simulation and analytical results gives confidence pertaining to the accuracy of the performed analysis and confirms the validity of the analytical framework. Thus, combined simulation and analytical analysis enables deep insight into the energy conversion phenomena in hybrid powertrains and reveals the advantages and disadvantages of both hybrid concepts running under different operating conditions. It is obvious from the presented results that the parallel hybrid powertrain features better fuel economy than the series one for the applied test cycles, whereas both hybrid powertrain concepts feature the best fuel economy at light-duty application.

Designing a hybrid drive train is a multiobjective design problem. The main design objectives are fuel consumption, emissions, and performance. However, it is difficult to find a global optimal integral design solution due to the interdependence of design choices (parameters) regarding the drive-train topology, component sizes, component technologies, and control strategy, as well as the unknown sensitivity of the design objectives to the design parameters. In this paper, a parametric optimization procedure is presented to solve the design problem, where the main design objective is fuel consumption. The effects of parameter variation on fuel consumption have been investigated. Furthermore, a reduced hybrid drive-train model is introduced, with which the effects of design parameter variation is very quickly studied with an average error of less than 1.6%.

D, [2015-07-23T21:01:16.829149 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Toyota is the pioneer in the hybrid electric vehicle, and today almost all major car assemblers produce hybrid cars. Now, several auto manufacturers are preparing for the commercial launches of battery powered electric vehicles in 2011. Another battle for dominance in electric car market has started. However, the development of technologies for electric cars has a very long history and presently there is a huge diversity of technological solutions in development. In order to understand the evolution of electric vehicles, we carried out two related case studies. In the first case study, we analyze the experience of General Motors in the last 40 years in developing electric vehicles. Our focuses are on the objectives of each development, technologies employed and external factors that stimulated each effort. The results show that in the first 20 years the main objective is to explore different technologies. The intention to launch a commercial electric vehicle only appears in the last 20 years. In the second case study, we analyze propulsion technologies and product architectures electric vehicles announced, in the last few years, by established auto manufacturers and new entrants. The results show that innovations in product architecture can provide a niche market for electric vehicles.

We synthesize the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modeling techniques such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models that perform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance. Although there are a set of fault prediction studies in which confidence is possible, more studies are needed that use a reliable methodology and which report their context, methodology, and performance comprehensively.

D, [2015-07-23T21:28:37.468415 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Distributed Software Development (DSD) emerged from the need to achieve geographically distant customers and currently, allows organizations have global customers and other benefits. This scenario has given rise to new Software Engineering challenges resulting from DSD particularities. Several Systematic Reviews were conducted to address these new challenges. The objective of this paper is to categorize systematic reviews conducted in DSD context. We used the systematic review method to identify SLRs (Systematic Literature Reviews) that address DSD aspects. This study is categorized as a tertiary review. Of fourteen SLRs, seven address aspects of managing distributed development. Four SLRs addressed topics of engineering process. The three remaining are related to Requirements, Design and Software Engineering Education in DSD. The topic areas covered by SLRs are limited, where the majority are focused on summarize the current knowledge concerning a research question. Despite the number of SLRs, the amount of empirical studies is relatively small.

D, [2015-07-23T21:28:37.601868 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context. Although research in software engineering largely seeks to improve the practices and products of software development, many practices are based upon codification of expert knowledge, often with little or no underpinning from objective empirical evidence. Software design patterns seek to codify expert knowledge to share experience about successful design structures. Objectives. To investigate how extensively the use of software design patterns has been subjected to empirical study and what evidence is available about how and when their use can provide an effective mechanism for knowledge transfer about design. Method. We conducted a systematic literature review in the form of a mapping study, searching the literature up to the end of 2009 to identify relevant primary studies about the use of the 23 patterns catalogued in the widely referenced book by the “Gang of Four.” These studies were then categorized according to the forms of study employed, the patterns that were studied, as well as the context within which the study took place. Results. Our searches identified 611 candidate papers. Applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria resulted in a final set of 10 papers that described 11 instances of “formal” experimental studies of object-oriented design patterns. We augmented our analysis by including seven “experience” reports that described application of patterns using less rigorous observational forms. We report and review the profiles of the empirical evidence for those patterns for which multiple studies exist. Conclusions. We could not identify firm support for any of the claims made for patterns in general, although there was some support for the usefulness of patterns in providing a framework for maintenance, and some qualitative indication that they do not help novices learn about design. For future studies we recommend that researchers use case studies that focus upon some key patterns, and seek to id- ntify the impact that their use can have upon maintenance.

D, [2015-07-23T21:28:37.724471 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: We identify three challenges related to the provenance of the material we use in teaching software engineering. We suggest that these challenges can be addressed by using evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) and its primary tool of systematic literature reviews (SLRs). This paper aims to assess the educational and scientific value of undergraduate and postgraduate students undertaking a specific form of SLR called a mapping study. Using a case study methodology, we asked three postgraduate students and three undergraduates and their supervisor to complete a questionnaire concerning the educational value of mapping studies and any problems they experienced. Students found undertaking a mapping study to be a valuable experience providing both reusable research skills and a good overview of a research topic. Postgraduates found it useful as a starting point for their studies. Undergraduates reported problems undertaking the study in the required timescales. Searching and classifying the literature was difficult.

D, [2015-07-23T21:28:37.836113 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context: There has been an increase in research into global software development (GSD) and in the number of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) addressing this topic. Objective: The aim of this research is to catalogue GSD SLRs in order to identify the topics covered, the active researchers, the publication vehicles, and to assess the quality of the SLRs identified. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs dealing with GSD. We differentiate between SLR studies and papers reporting those studies. Data relating to each of the following was extracted and synthesized from each study: authors and their affiliation at the time of publication, the journal or conference in which the paper was published, the quality of each study and the main GSD study topic. Results: Twenty-four GSD SLR studies and 37 papers reporting those studies were identified. Major GSD topics covered include: (1) organizational environment, (2) project execution, and (3) project planning and control. The main research groups are based in Brazil (17), Ireland (8), and Sweden (7). Conclusions: GSD SLR studies are most frequently reported in the International Conference on Global Software Engineering and IEEE Software; the two most popular topics for research are risk factors due to the organizational environment and the development process. The most active researchers are based in Brazil. The quality of the SLR studies has not changed over time.

We used a participant-observer multi-case embedded case study. Our two cases were a tertiary study of systematic literature reviews published between January 2004 and June 2007 based on a manual search of selected journals and conferences and a replication of that study based on a broad automated search. Broad searches find more papers than restricted searches, but the papers may be of poor quality. Researchers undertaking SLRs may be justified in using targeted manual searches if they intend to omit low quality papers; if publication bias is not an issue; or if they are assessing research trends in research methodologies.

D, [2015-07-23T21:28:38.114389 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Software quality requirements (SQR) play a central role in software quality (SQ) success. The importance of mastering SQR can be seen as obvious, however, when it comes to customer satisfaction, end-users are often dissatisfied with SQ. In this paper, a systematic mapping study aims to summarize SQR research by answering nine mapping questions. In total, 51 articles were selected and classified according to multiple criteria: publication source, publication year, research type, research approach, contribution type of SQR literature, requirements engineering activity, well-known SQ model, software artifact and SQR type. The results show an increased interest in SQR research in recent years and reveal that conferences are the main SQR publication target. Most SQR research has used case studies. The dominant contribution type of SQR research is method while specification is the main requirements engineering activity identified. SQ models need to be more used for SQR identification. Design module and requirements documentation are the principal artifacts reported in SQR literature. External and internal SQR were the main SQR types addressed in literature. Identifying empirical solutions to address SQR is a promising research direction for researchers.

Before undue reliance is placed on the outcomes of such reviews it would seem useful to consider the robustness of the approach in this particular research context. OBJECTIVE-The aim of this study is to assess the reliability of systematic reviews as a research instrument. In particular, we wish to investigate the consistency of process and the stability of outcomes. METHOD-We compare the results of two independent reviews undertaken with a common research question. RESULTS-The two reviews find similar answers to the research question, although the means of arriving at those answers vary. CONCLUSIONS-In addressing a well-bounded research question, groups of researchers with similar domain experience can arrive at the same review outcomes, even though they may do so in different ways. This provides evidence that, in this context at least, the systematic review is a robust research method.

D, [2015-07-23T21:28:38.404048 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Software evolution is recognized as one of the most challenging areas in the field of Software Engineering. The observation of evolution is time-dependent, reducing opportunities for actual observations in short periods of time. Usually, maintenance cycles are proportional to the software life cycle. Therefore, the amount of research has not been enough to deal with all the issues related to the evolution of software. However, simulation through confident models represents an interesting strategy to support software decay observation in short period of time. Towards that, this paper describes a model aimed at supporting the software decay simulation through systems dynamics. The Laws of Software Evolution and ISO 9126 were used as initial knowledge to support the discovery of software characteristic (size, periodicity, complexity, effort, reliability, and maintainability) relationships. Next, evidence to strengthen the existence of such relationships was acquired through quasi-systematic literature reviews. In sequence, the model was applied to support the simulation of industrial software decay. The results suggested its feasibility and correctness, making it an interesting candidate to support future software decay studies.

Our previous studies have assessed these using the subjective opinions of researchers. Objective: In order to provide a more objective assessment of value, for this study, we used the results of a systematic mapping study to investigate how well mapping studies identify clusters of related studies and to what extent such clusters are complete. Method: In this participant-observer case study, we undertook a mapping study of unit testing and regression testing empirical studies, which we compared with a previous expert literature review and with six other mapping studies and systematic literature reviews (SLRs) that addressed overlapping topics. Results: Our mapping study found more clusters than the expert literature review although it benefited from the set of studies identified by the expert review when refining our search process. The set of studies found by our searches were less complete than those found by SLRs addressing more specific topics, although we found some studies missed by those SLRs. Conclusions: Researchers undertaking systematic reviews and mapping studies should make use of related systematic reviews and mapping studies to identify known studies in order to refine search strings and validate search results. For completeness and traceability, mapping studies should keep a record of all multiple reports of a single study. Meta-analyses and other systematic literature reviews undertaking detailed aggregation should report on candidate primary studies that were rejected in the final screening process, as well as candidate studies that were included. This helps ensure the repeatability of aggregation results.

D, [2015-07-23T21:28:38.704939 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background--By leveraging cloud services, organizations can deploy their software systems over a pool of resources. However, organizations heavily depend on their business-critical systems, which have been developed over long periods. These legacy applications are usually deployed on-premise. In recent years, research in cloud migration has been carried out. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate this research. Objective--This paper aims to identify, taxonomically classify, and systematically compare existing research on cloud migration. Method--We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 23 selected studies, published from 2010 to 2013. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework that we also introduce in this paper. Results--The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of current solutions for legacy-to-cloud migration. This review also identifies research gaps and directions for future research. Conclusion--This review reveals that cloud migration research is still in early stages of maturity, but is advancing. It identifies the needs for a migration framework to help improving the maturity level and consequently trust into cloud migration. This review shows a lack of tool support to automate migration tasks. This study also identifies needs for architectural adaptation and self-adaptive cloud-enabled systems.

D, [2015-07-23T21:28:38.827536 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) have been gaining significant attention from software engineering researchers since 2004. Several researchers have reported their experiences of and lessons learned from applying systematic reviews to different subject matters in software engineering. However, there has been no attempt at independently exploring experiences and perceptions of the practitioners of systematic reviews in order to gain an in-depth understanding of various aspects of systemic reviews as a new research methodology in software engineering. We assert that there is a need of evidence based body of knowledge about the application of systematic reviews in software engineering. To address this need, we have started an empirical research program that aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge about systematic reviews in software engineering. This paper reports the design, logistics, and results of the first phase empirical study carried out in this program. The results provide interesting insights into different aspects of systematic reviews based on the analysis of the data gathered from 17 interviewees with varying levels of knowledge of and experiences in systematic reviews. The findings from this study are expected to contribute to the existing knowledge about using systematic reviews and help further improve the state-of-the-practice of this research methodology in software engineering.

D, [2015-07-23T21:28:38.951958 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: There has been a growing interest in the role of theory within Software Engineering (SE) research. For several decades, researchers within the SE research community have argued that, to become a real engineering science, SE needs to develop stronger theoretical foundations. A few authors have proposed guidelines for constructing theories, building on insights from other disciplines. However, so far, much SE research is not guided by explicit theory, nor does it produce explicit theory. In this paper we argue that SE research does, in fact, show traces of theory, which we call theory fragments. We have adapted an analytical framework from the social sciences, named the Validity Network Schema (VNS), that we use to illustrate the role of theorizing in SE research. We illustrate the use of this framework by dissecting three well known research papers, each of which has had significant impact on their respective subdisciplines. We conclude this paper by outlining a number of implications for future SE research, and show how by increasing awareness and training, development of SE theories can be improved.

D, [2015-07-23T21:28:39.288260 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) is difficult and time-consuming for an experienced researcher, and even more so for a novice graduate student. With a better understanding of the most common difficulties in the SLR process, mentors will be better prepared to guide novices through the process. This understanding will help researchers have more realistic expectations of the SLR process and will help mentors guide novices through its planning, execution, and documentation phases. Consequently, the objectives of this work are to identify the most difficult and time-consuming phases of the SLR process. Using data from two sources - 52 responses to an online survey sent to all authors of SLRs published in software engineering venues and qualitative experience reports from 8 PhD students who conducted SLRs as part of a course - we identified specific difficulties related to each phase of the SLR process. Our findings highlight the importance of planning, teamwork, and mentoring by an experienced researcher throughout the process. The paper also identifies implications for the teaching of the SLR process.

Of all these, our research line is focused on designing the specific training that members of virtual teams must receive. Universities and companies therefore need to design training schemas to deal with the specifics of GSD, which are principally related to communication difficulties and time and cultural differences. In this work we present the findings of a Systematic Literature Review in the field of GSD training and teaching. Our intention is twofold: on the one hand we wish to discover the existing strategies and proposals available up to the present day, and on the other hand we wish to identify the open challenges, that will be helpful for practitioners and researchers in the future.

This research, inspired by the Impact Project, intends to investigate the technology transfer of software process simulation to the use in industrial settings, and further identify the best practices to release its full potential in software practice. We collected the reported applications of process simulation in software industry, and identified its wide adoption in the organizations delivering various software intensive systems. This paper, as an initial report of the research, briefs a historical perspective of the impact upon practice based on the documented evidence, and also elaborates the research-practice transition by examining one detailed case study. It is shown that research has a significant impact on practice in this area. The analysis of impact trace also reveals that the success of software process simulation in practice highly relies on the association with other software process techniques or practices and the close collaboration between researchers and practitioners.

To attempt to resolve these issues an examination of the non-regulated industry was performed to determine if lessons learned there could be applied to the development of medical device software This examination revealed that agile methods are being widely adopted in the non-regulated software industry. To learn if agile methods could be adopted when developing medical device software a mapping study was performed which looked for instances of where agile methods have been used in regulated industries and where they have been adopted, to what success This mapping study revealed that incorporating agile practices with the existing plan driven SDLC is the most favourable choice for medical device software organizations. This research aims to develop a SDLC which has a foundation of a plan driven SDLC which incorporates agile practices which can be followed when developing regulatory compliant software.

Method-A previously conducted systematic review (Sulayman and Mendes, 2009) has been updated and extended to identify the current state of research on the mentioned topic. Results Eight studies applied SPI techniques or models to small and medium Web companies. The selected studies did not suggest any customized model or technique to measure the SPI of small and medium Web companies. The characteristics of some small and medium companies such as tight budget constraints, tight deadlines and a short term strategy were also identified. The measures of success for small and medium Web companies, as per SR results, include development team and client satisfaction, increase in productivity, compliance with standards and overall operational excellence. Conclusions-The results of this review, like our previously conducted systematic review (Sulayman and Mendes, 2009), show that very few studies have specifically focused on SPI for Web companies, despite the large number of existing Web companies worldwide, and the even larger number of Web applications being currently developed. This clearly indicates a research gap in this area, with numerous avenues for future work.

D, [2015-07-23T21:28:39.998661 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context: Software systems are increasingly required to operate in an open world, characterized by continuous changes in the environment and in the prescribed requirements. Architecture-centric software evolution (ACSE) is considered as an approach to support software adaptation at a controllable level of abstraction in order to survive in the uncertain environment. This requires evolution in system structure and behavior that can be modeled, analyzed and evolved in a formal fashion. Existing research and practices comprise a wide spectrum of evolution-centric approaches in terms of formalisms, methods, processes and frameworks to tackle ACSE as well as empirical studies to consolidate existing research. However, there is no unified framework providing systematic insight into classification and comparison of state-of-the-art in ACSE research. Objective: We present a taxonomic scheme for a classification and comparison of existing ACSE research approaches, leading to a reflection on areas of future research. Method: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR), resulting in 4138 papers searched and 60 peer-reviewed papers considered for data collection. We populated the taxonomic scheme based on a quantitative and qualitative extraction of data items from the included studies. Results: We identified five main classification categories: (i) type of evolution, (ii) type of specification, (iii) type of architectural reasoning, (iv) runtime issues, and (v) tool support. The selected studies are compared based on their claims and supporting evidences through the scheme. Conclusion: The classification scheme provides a critical view of different aspects to be considered when addressing specific ACSE problems. Besides, the consolidation of the ACSE evidences reflects current trends and the needs for future research directions.

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review that applies the 5W+1H model, which is widely used in the journalism domain, to report the full picture of the research area in both software engineering and services computing. Existing guidelines on systematic literature review heavily rely on the researcher to pose the right research questions, and the review results are tightly focused on these research questions. For researchers new to a field, defining the right research questions that are effective in revealing the critical issues in the field can be challenging. Our case study demonstrates that the 5W+1H model provides an easy aid for the researcher to get over such initial challenges. As the researcher becomes more familiar with the field, he/she may then refine the research questions by adding more topic-specific contexts. In this way, the 5W+1H model serves to provide an exploratory framework to shape a systematic literature review. Applying to software testing for cloud computing, we are able to synthesize a comprehensive picture of recent researches on the field, including publication pattern, article citation immediacy, research topic diversity, research ideas for addressing testing challenges at different cloud service architectural layers. Based on the case study, we summarize the lessons learned on using the 5W+1H model in reporting systematic literature review.

It first appeared in the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference as means to overcome the software crisis. This study aims to investigate how the Software engineering area is evolving, by analyzing the 24 editions of Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES), and understanding which is the impact of international research in this event. A scoping study was performed to figure out how the SE area is evolving and if it suffers influences from international research. We found 512 studies over the 24 SBES editions, which were analyzed and discussed. Based on the analysis, we observed that in the first years there were a few empirical studies; most of them were of theoretical nature. The industry participation and interest still continuous over the editions. Regarding to international impact, we did not find any relation with international research. Our findings suggest that greater attention should be given to the Software Engineering area, with the aim to attract research from industry with real data, and also international collaboration.

D, [2015-07-23T21:28:40.399882 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background: A systematic literature review (SLR) is a methodology used to aggregate all relevant existing evidence to answer a research question of interest. Although crucial, the process used to select primary studies can be arduous, time consuming, and must often be conducted manually. Objective: We propose a novel approach, known as 'Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM, to support the primary study selection activity using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. Method: We conducted a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach. To enable the comparison, we also developed a VTM tool that implemented our approach. We hypothesized that students using SLR-VTM would present improved selection performance and effectiveness. Results: Our results show that incorporating VTM in the SLR study selection activity reduced the time spent in this activity and also increased the number of studies correctly included. Conclusions: Our pilot case study presents promising results suggesting that the use of VTM may indeed be beneficial during the study selection activity when performing an SLR.

D, [2015-07-23T21:28:40.522665 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Teaching programming to novices is a difficult task due to the complex nature of the subject, the negative stereotypes are associated with programming and because introductory programming courses often fail to encourage student understanding. This study investigates the effectiveness of using robots as tools in the teaching of introductory programming and to determine whether such technology can help to overcome the current barriers for learners in this context. The systematic literature review (SLR) methodology is used to address this aim. Nine electronic databases, the proceedings from six conferences and two journals were searched for relevant literature and exclusion criteria, and after performing several validation exercises, in total, 75% of included papers report that robots are an effective teaching tool and can help novice programmers in their studies. Most of these papers focus on the use of physical robots, however, and further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of using simulated robots.

D, [2015-07-23T21:28:40.648476 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have become an established methodology in software engineering (SE) research however they can be very time consuming and error prone. Aim: The aims of this study are to identify and classify tools that can help to automate part or all of the SLR process within the SE domain. Method: A mapping study was performed using an automated search strategy plus snowballing to locate relevant papers. A set of known papers was used to validate the search string. Results: 14 papers were accepted into the final set. Eight presented text mining tools and six discussed the use of visualisation techniques. The stage most commonly targeted was study selection. Only two papers reported an independent evaluation of the tool presented. The majority were evaluated through small experiments and examples of their use. Conclusions: A variety of tools are available to support the SLR process although many are in the early stages of development and usage.

OBJECTIVE-This paper aims to identify and characterize evaluation strategies and measurements used to assess the impact of different SPI initiatives. METHOD-The systematic literature review includes 148 papers published between 1991 and 2008. The selected papers were classified according to SPI initiative, applied evaluation strategies, and measurement perspectives. Potential confounding factors interfering with the evaluation of the improvement effort were assessed. RESULTS-Seven distinct evaluation strategies were identified, wherein the most common one, “Pre-Post Comparison,” was applied in 49 percent of the inspected papers. Quality was the most measured attribute (62 percent), followed by Cost (41 percent), and Schedule (18 percent). Looking at measurement perspectives, “Project” represents the majority with 66 percent. CONCLUSION-The evaluation validity of SPI initiatives is challenged by the scarce consideration of potential confounding factors, particularly given that “Pre-Post Comparison” was identified as the most common evaluation strategy, and the inaccurate descriptions of the evaluation context. Measurements to assess the short and mid-term impact of SPI initiatives prevail, whereas long-term measurements in terms of customer satisfaction and return on investment tend to be less used.

Objective: We investigate how the context of models, the independent variables used, and the modeling techniques applied influence the performance of fault prediction models. Method: We used a systematic literature review to identify 208 fault prediction studies published from January 2000 to December 2010. We synthesize the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modeling techniques such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models that perform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance. Although there are a set of fault prediction studies in which confidence is possible, more studies are needed that use a reliable methodology and which report their context, methodology, and performance comprehensively.

D, [2015-07-23T21:30:49.967013 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Distributed Software Development (DSD) emerged from the need to achieve geographically distant customers and currently, allows organizations have global customers and other benefits. This scenario has given rise to new Software Engineering challenges resulting from DSD particularities. Several Systematic Reviews were conducted to address these new challenges. The objective of this paper is to categorize systematic reviews conducted in DSD context. We used the systematic review method to identify SLRs (Systematic Literature Reviews) that address DSD aspects. This study is categorized as a tertiary review. Of fourteen SLRs, seven address aspects of managing distributed development. Four SLRs addressed topics of engineering process. The three remaining are related to Requirements, Design and Software Engineering Education in DSD. The topic areas covered by SLRs are limited, where the majority are focused on summarize the current knowledge concerning a research question. Despite the number of SLRs, the amount of empirical studies is relatively small.

D, [2015-07-23T21:30:50.122643 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context. Although research in software engineering largely seeks to improve the practices and products of software development, many practices are based upon codification of expert knowledge, often with little or no underpinning from objective empirical evidence. Software design patterns seek to codify expert knowledge to share experience about successful design structures. Objectives. To investigate how extensively the use of software design patterns has been subjected to empirical study and what evidence is available about how and when their use can provide an effective mechanism for knowledge transfer about design. Method. We conducted a systematic literature review in the form of a mapping study, searching the literature up to the end of 2009 to identify relevant primary studies about the use of the 23 patterns catalogued in the widely referenced book by the “Gang of Four.” These studies were then categorized according to the forms of study employed, the patterns that were studied, as well as the context within which the study took place. Results. Our searches identified 611 candidate papers. Applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria resulted in a final set of 10 papers that described 11 instances of “formal” experimental studies of object-oriented design patterns. We augmented our analysis by including seven “experience” reports that described application of patterns using less rigorous observational forms. We report and review the profiles of the empirical evidence for those patterns for which multiple studies exist. Conclusions. We could not identify firm support for any of the claims made for patterns in general, although there was some support for the usefulness of patterns in providing a framework for maintenance, and some qualitative indication that they do not help novices learn about design. For future studies we recommend that researchers use case studies that focus upon some key patterns, and seek to id- ntify the impact that their use can have upon maintenance.

We suggest that these challenges can be addressed by using evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) and its primary tool of systematic literature reviews (SLRs). This paper aims to assess the educational and scientific value of undergraduate and postgraduate students undertaking a specific form of SLR called a mapping study. Using a case study methodology, we asked three postgraduate students and three undergraduates and their supervisor to complete a questionnaire concerning the educational value of mapping studies and any problems they experienced. Students found undertaking a mapping study to be a valuable experience providing both reusable research skills and a good overview of a research topic. Postgraduates found it useful as a starting point for their studies. Undergraduates reported problems undertaking the study in the required timescales. Searching and classifying the literature was difficult.

Objective: The aim of this research is to catalogue GSD SLRs in order to identify the topics covered, the active researchers, the publication vehicles, and to assess the quality of the SLRs identified. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs dealing with GSD. We differentiate between SLR studies and papers reporting those studies. Data relating to each of the following was extracted and synthesized from each study: authors and their affiliation at the time of publication, the journal or conference in which the paper was published, the quality of each study and the main GSD study topic. Results: Twenty-four GSD SLR studies and 37 papers reporting those studies were identified. Major GSD topics covered include: (1) organizational environment, (2) project execution, and (3) project planning and control. The main research groups are based in Brazil (17), Ireland (8), and Sweden (7). Conclusions: GSD SLR studies are most frequently reported in the International Conference on Global Software Engineering and IEEE Software; the two most popular topics for research are risk factors due to the organizational environment and the development process. The most active researchers are based in Brazil. The quality of the SLR studies has not changed over time.

We used a participant-observer multi-case embedded case study. Our two cases were a tertiary study of systematic literature reviews published between January 2004 and June 2007 based on a manual search of selected journals and conferences and a replication of that study based on a broad automated search. Broad searches find more papers than restricted searches, but the papers may be of poor quality. Researchers undertaking SLRs may be justified in using targeted manual searches if they intend to omit low quality papers; if publication bias is not an issue; or if they are assessing research trends in research methodologies.

The importance of mastering SQR can be seen as obvious, however, when it comes to customer satisfaction, end-users are often dissatisfied with SQ. In this paper, a systematic mapping study aims to summarize SQR research by answering nine mapping questions. In total, 51 articles were selected and classified according to multiple criteria: publication source, publication year, research type, research approach, contribution type of SQR literature, requirements engineering activity, well-known SQ model, software artifact and SQR type. The results show an increased interest in SQR research in recent years and reveal that conferences are the main SQR publication target. Most SQR research has used case studies. The dominant contribution type of SQR research is method while specification is the main requirements engineering activity identified. SQ models need to be more used for SQR identification. Design module and requirements documentation are the principal artifacts reported in SQR literature. External and internal SQR were the main SQR types addressed in literature. Identifying empirical solutions to address SQR is a promising research direction for researchers.

Before undue reliance is placed on the outcomes of such reviews it would seem useful to consider the robustness of the approach in this particular research context. OBJECTIVE-The aim of this study is to assess the reliability of systematic reviews as a research instrument. In particular, we wish to investigate the consistency of process and the stability of outcomes. METHOD-We compare the results of two independent reviews undertaken with a common research question. RESULTS-The two reviews find similar answers to the research question, although the means of arriving at those answers vary. CONCLUSIONS-In addressing a well-bounded research question, groups of researchers with similar domain experience can arrive at the same review outcomes, even though they may do so in different ways. This provides evidence that, in this context at least, the systematic review is a robust research method.

D, [2015-07-23T21:30:50.957473 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Software evolution is recognized as one of the most challenging areas in the field of Software Engineering. The observation of evolution is time-dependent, reducing opportunities for actual observations in short periods of time. Usually, maintenance cycles are proportional to the software life cycle. Therefore, the amount of research has not been enough to deal with all the issues related to the evolution of software. However, simulation through confident models represents an interesting strategy to support software decay observation in short period of time. Towards that, this paper describes a model aimed at supporting the software decay simulation through systems dynamics. The Laws of Software Evolution and ISO 9126 were used as initial knowledge to support the discovery of software characteristic (size, periodicity, complexity, effort, reliability, and maintainability) relationships. Next, evidence to strengthen the existence of such relationships was acquired through quasi-systematic literature reviews. In sequence, the model was applied to support the simulation of industrial software decay. The results suggested its feasibility and correctness, making it an interesting candidate to support future software decay studies.

D, [2015-07-23T21:30:51.081191 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context: We have been undertaking a series of case studies to investigate the value of mapping (scoping) studies in software engineering. Our previous studies have assessed these using the subjective opinions of researchers. Objective: In order to provide a more objective assessment of value, for this study, we used the results of a systematic mapping study to investigate how well mapping studies identify clusters of related studies and to what extent such clusters are complete. Method: In this participant-observer case study, we undertook a mapping study of unit testing and regression testing empirical studies, which we compared with a previous expert literature review and with six other mapping studies and systematic literature reviews (SLRs) that addressed overlapping topics. Results: Our mapping study found more clusters than the expert literature review although it benefited from the set of studies identified by the expert review when refining our search process. The set of studies found by our searches were less complete than those found by SLRs addressing more specific topics, although we found some studies missed by those SLRs. Conclusions: Researchers undertaking systematic reviews and mapping studies should make use of related systematic reviews and mapping studies to identify known studies in order to refine search strings and validate search results. For completeness and traceability, mapping studies should keep a record of all multiple reports of a single study. Meta-analyses and other systematic literature reviews undertaking detailed aggregation should report on candidate primary studies that were rejected in the final screening process, as well as candidate studies that were included. This helps ensure the repeatability of aggregation results.

D, [2015-07-23T21:30:51.192795 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background--By leveraging cloud services, organizations can deploy their software systems over a pool of resources. However, organizations heavily depend on their business-critical systems, which have been developed over long periods. These legacy applications are usually deployed on-premise. In recent years, research in cloud migration has been carried out. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate this research. Objective--This paper aims to identify, taxonomically classify, and systematically compare existing research on cloud migration. Method--We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 23 selected studies, published from 2010 to 2013. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework that we also introduce in this paper. Results--The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of current solutions for legacy-to-cloud migration. This review also identifies research gaps and directions for future research. Conclusion--This review reveals that cloud migration research is still in early stages of maturity, but is advancing. It identifies the needs for a migration framework to help improving the maturity level and consequently trust into cloud migration. This review shows a lack of tool support to automate migration tasks. This study also identifies needs for architectural adaptation and self-adaptive cloud-enabled systems.

D, [2015-07-23T21:30:51.304189 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) have been gaining significant attention from software engineering researchers since 2004. Several researchers have reported their experiences of and lessons learned from applying systematic reviews to different subject matters in software engineering. However, there has been no attempt at independently exploring experiences and perceptions of the practitioners of systematic reviews in order to gain an in-depth understanding of various aspects of systemic reviews as a new research methodology in software engineering. We assert that there is a need of evidence based body of knowledge about the application of systematic reviews in software engineering. To address this need, we have started an empirical research program that aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge about systematic reviews in software engineering. This paper reports the design, logistics, and results of the first phase empirical study carried out in this program. The results provide interesting insights into different aspects of systematic reviews based on the analysis of the data gathered from 17 interviewees with varying levels of knowledge of and experiences in systematic reviews. The findings from this study are expected to contribute to the existing knowledge about using systematic reviews and help further improve the state-of-the-practice of this research methodology in software engineering.

D, [2015-07-23T21:30:51.415935 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: There has been a growing interest in the role of theory within Software Engineering (SE) research. For several decades, researchers within the SE research community have argued that, to become a real engineering science, SE needs to develop stronger theoretical foundations. A few authors have proposed guidelines for constructing theories, building on insights from other disciplines. However, so far, much SE research is not guided by explicit theory, nor does it produce explicit theory. In this paper we argue that SE research does, in fact, show traces of theory, which we call theory fragments. We have adapted an analytical framework from the social sciences, named the Validity Network Schema (VNS), that we use to illustrate the role of theorizing in SE research. We illustrate the use of this framework by dissecting three well known research papers, each of which has had significant impact on their respective subdisciplines. We conclude this paper by outlining a number of implications for future SE research, and show how by increasing awareness and training, development of SE theories can be improved.

D, [2015-07-23T21:30:51.527173 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) is difficult and time-consuming for an experienced researcher, and even more so for a novice graduate student. With a better understanding of the most common difficulties in the SLR process, mentors will be better prepared to guide novices through the process. This understanding will help researchers have more realistic expectations of the SLR process and will help mentors guide novices through its planning, execution, and documentation phases. Consequently, the objectives of this work are to identify the most difficult and time-consuming phases of the SLR process. Using data from two sources - 52 responses to an online survey sent to all authors of SLRs published in software engineering venues and qualitative experience reports from 8 PhD students who conducted SLRs as part of a course - we identified specific difficulties related to each phase of the SLR process. Our findings highlight the importance of planning, teamwork, and mentoring by an experienced researcher throughout the process. The paper also identifies implications for the teaching of the SLR process.

Universities and companies therefore need to design training schemas to deal with the specifics of GSD, which are principally related to communication difficulties and time and cultural differences. In this work we present the findings of a Systematic Literature Review in the field of GSD training and teaching. Our intention is twofold: on the one hand we wish to discover the existing strategies and proposals available up to the present day, and on the other hand we wish to identify the open challenges, that will be helpful for practitioners and researchers in the future.

This research, inspired by the Impact Project, intends to investigate the technology transfer of software process simulation to the use in industrial settings, and further identify the best practices to release its full potential in software practice. We collected the reported applications of process simulation in software industry, and identified its wide adoption in the organizations delivering various software intensive systems. This paper, as an initial report of the research, briefs a historical perspective of the impact upon practice based on the documented evidence, and also elaborates the research-practice transition by examining one detailed case study. It is shown that research has a significant impact on practice in this area. The analysis of impact trace also reveals that the success of software process simulation in practice highly relies on the association with other software process techniques or practices and the close collaboration between researchers and practitioners.

To attempt to resolve these issues an examination of the non-regulated industry was performed to determine if lessons learned there could be applied to the development of medical device software This examination revealed that agile methods are being widely adopted in the non-regulated software industry. To learn if agile methods could be adopted when developing medical device software a mapping study was performed which looked for instances of where agile methods have been used in regulated industries and where they have been adopted, to what success This mapping study revealed that incorporating agile practices with the existing plan driven SDLC is the most favourable choice for medical device software organizations. This research aims to develop a SDLC which has a foundation of a plan driven SDLC which incorporates agile practices which can be followed when developing regulatory compliant software.

Method-A previously conducted systematic review (Sulayman and Mendes, 2009) has been updated and extended to identify the current state of research on the mentioned topic. Results Eight studies applied SPI techniques or models to small and medium Web companies. The selected studies did not suggest any customized model or technique to measure the SPI of small and medium Web companies. The characteristics of some small and medium companies such as tight budget constraints, tight deadlines and a short term strategy were also identified. The measures of success for small and medium Web companies, as per SR results, include development team and client satisfaction, increase in productivity, compliance with standards and overall operational excellence. Conclusions-The results of this review, like our previously conducted systematic review (Sulayman and Mendes, 2009), show that very few studies have specifically focused on SPI for Web companies, despite the large number of existing Web companies worldwide, and the even larger number of Web applications being currently developed. This clearly indicates a research gap in this area, with numerous avenues for future work.

D, [2015-07-23T21:30:52.173042 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context: Software systems are increasingly required to operate in an open world, characterized by continuous changes in the environment and in the prescribed requirements. Architecture-centric software evolution (ACSE) is considered as an approach to support software adaptation at a controllable level of abstraction in order to survive in the uncertain environment. This requires evolution in system structure and behavior that can be modeled, analyzed and evolved in a formal fashion. Existing research and practices comprise a wide spectrum of evolution-centric approaches in terms of formalisms, methods, processes and frameworks to tackle ACSE as well as empirical studies to consolidate existing research. However, there is no unified framework providing systematic insight into classification and comparison of state-of-the-art in ACSE research. Objective: We present a taxonomic scheme for a classification and comparison of existing ACSE research approaches, leading to a reflection on areas of future research. Method: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR), resulting in 4138 papers searched and 60 peer-reviewed papers considered for data collection. We populated the taxonomic scheme based on a quantitative and qualitative extraction of data items from the included studies. Results: We identified five main classification categories: (i) type of evolution, (ii) type of specification, (iii) type of architectural reasoning, (iv) runtime issues, and (v) tool support. The selected studies are compared based on their claims and supporting evidences through the scheme. Conclusion: The classification scheme provides a critical view of different aspects to be considered when addressing specific ACSE problems. Besides, the consolidation of the ACSE evidences reflects current trends and the needs for future research directions.

D, [2015-07-23T21:30:52.295638 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper documents a case study of using the 5W+1H model for reporting systematic literature review on software testing for cloud computing. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review that applies the 5W+1H model, which is widely used in the journalism domain, to report the full picture of the research area in both software engineering and services computing. Existing guidelines on systematic literature review heavily rely on the researcher to pose the right research questions, and the review results are tightly focused on these research questions. For researchers new to a field, defining the right research questions that are effective in revealing the critical issues in the field can be challenging. Our case study demonstrates that the 5W+1H model provides an easy aid for the researcher to get over such initial challenges. As the researcher becomes more familiar with the field, he/she may then refine the research questions by adding more topic-specific contexts. In this way, the 5W+1H model serves to provide an exploratory framework to shape a systematic literature review. Applying to software testing for cloud computing, we are able to synthesize a comprehensive picture of recent researches on the field, including publication pattern, article citation immediacy, research topic diversity, research ideas for addressing testing challenges at different cloud service architectural layers. Based on the case study, we summarize the lessons learned on using the 5W+1H model in reporting systematic literature review.

It first appeared in the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference as means to overcome the software crisis. This study aims to investigate how the Software engineering area is evolving, by analyzing the 24 editions of Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES), and understanding which is the impact of international research in this event. A scoping study was performed to figure out how the SE area is evolving and if it suffers influences from international research. We found 512 studies over the 24 SBES editions, which were analyzed and discussed. Based on the analysis, we observed that in the first years there were a few empirical studies; most of them were of theoretical nature. The industry participation and interest still continuous over the editions. Regarding to international impact, we did not find any relation with international research. Our findings suggest that greater attention should be given to the Software Engineering area, with the aim to attract research from industry with real data, and also international collaboration.

D, [2015-07-23T21:30:52.607091 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background: A systematic literature review (SLR) is a methodology used to aggregate all relevant existing evidence to answer a research question of interest. Although crucial, the process used to select primary studies can be arduous, time consuming, and must often be conducted manually. Objective: We propose a novel approach, known as 'Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM, to support the primary study selection activity using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. Method: We conducted a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach. To enable the comparison, we also developed a VTM tool that implemented our approach. We hypothesized that students using SLR-VTM would present improved selection performance and effectiveness. Results: Our results show that incorporating VTM in the SLR study selection activity reduced the time spent in this activity and also increased the number of studies correctly included. Conclusions: Our pilot case study presents promising results suggesting that the use of VTM may indeed be beneficial during the study selection activity when performing an SLR.

This study investigates the effectiveness of using robots as tools in the teaching of introductory programming and to determine whether such technology can help to overcome the current barriers for learners in this context. The systematic literature review (SLR) methodology is used to address this aim. Nine electronic databases, the proceedings from six conferences and two journals were searched for relevant literature and exclusion criteria, and after performing several validation exercises, in total, 75% of included papers report that robots are an effective teaching tool and can help novice programmers in their studies. Most of these papers focus on the use of physical robots, however, and further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of using simulated robots.

Aim: The aims of this study are to identify and classify tools that can help to automate part or all of the SLR process within the SE domain. Method: A mapping study was performed using an automated search strategy plus snowballing to locate relevant papers. A set of known papers was used to validate the search string. Results: 14 papers were accepted into the final set. Eight presented text mining tools and six discussed the use of visualisation techniques. The stage most commonly targeted was study selection. Only two papers reported an independent evaluation of the tool presented. The majority were evaluated through small experiments and examples of their use. Conclusions: A variety of tools are available to support the SLR process although many are in the early stages of development and usage.

D, [2015-07-23T21:31:20.272283 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: BACKGROUND-Software Process Improvement (SPI) is a systematic approach to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of a software development organization and to enhance software products. OBJECTIVE-This paper aims to identify and characterize evaluation strategies and measurements used to assess the impact of different SPI initiatives. METHOD-The systematic literature review includes 148 papers published between 1991 and 2008. The selected papers were classified according to SPI initiative, applied evaluation strategies, and measurement perspectives. Potential confounding factors interfering with the evaluation of the improvement effort were assessed. RESULTS-Seven distinct evaluation strategies were identified, wherein the most common one, “Pre-Post Comparison,” was applied in 49 percent of the inspected papers. Quality was the most measured attribute (62 percent), followed by Cost (41 percent), and Schedule (18 percent). Looking at measurement perspectives, “Project” represents the majority with 66 percent. CONCLUSION-The evaluation validity of SPI initiatives is challenged by the scarce consideration of potential confounding factors, particularly given that “Pre-Post Comparison” was identified as the most common evaluation strategy, and the inaccurate descriptions of the evaluation context. Measurements to assess the short and mid-term impact of SPI initiatives prevail, whereas long-term measurements in terms of customer satisfaction and return on investment tend to be less used.

Objective: We investigate how the context of models, the independent variables used, and the modeling techniques applied influence the performance of fault prediction models. Method: We used a systematic literature review to identify 208 fault prediction studies published from January 2000 to December 2010. We synthesize the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modeling techniques such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models that perform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance. Although there are a set of fault prediction studies in which confidence is possible, more studies are needed that use a reliable methodology and which report their context, methodology, and performance comprehensively.

This scenario has given rise to new Software Engineering challenges resulting from DSD particularities. Several Systematic Reviews were conducted to address these new challenges. The objective of this paper is to categorize systematic reviews conducted in DSD context. We used the systematic review method to identify SLRs (Systematic Literature Reviews) that address DSD aspects. This study is categorized as a tertiary review. Of fourteen SLRs, seven address aspects of managing distributed development. Four SLRs addressed topics of engineering process. The three remaining are related to Requirements, Design and Software Engineering Education in DSD. The topic areas covered by SLRs are limited, where the majority are focused on summarize the current knowledge concerning a research question. Despite the number of SLRs, the amount of empirical studies is relatively small.

D, [2015-07-23T21:31:20.741295 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context. Although research in software engineering largely seeks to improve the practices and products of software development, many practices are based upon codification of expert knowledge, often with little or no underpinning from objective empirical evidence. Software design patterns seek to codify expert knowledge to share experience about successful design structures. Objectives. To investigate how extensively the use of software design patterns has been subjected to empirical study and what evidence is available about how and when their use can provide an effective mechanism for knowledge transfer about design. Method. We conducted a systematic literature review in the form of a mapping study, searching the literature up to the end of 2009 to identify relevant primary studies about the use of the 23 patterns catalogued in the widely referenced book by the “Gang of Four.” These studies were then categorized according to the forms of study employed, the patterns that were studied, as well as the context within which the study took place. Results. Our searches identified 611 candidate papers. Applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria resulted in a final set of 10 papers that described 11 instances of “formal” experimental studies of object-oriented design patterns. We augmented our analysis by including seven “experience” reports that described application of patterns using less rigorous observational forms. We report and review the profiles of the empirical evidence for those patterns for which multiple studies exist. Conclusions. We could not identify firm support for any of the claims made for patterns in general, although there was some support for the usefulness of patterns in providing a framework for maintenance, and some qualitative indication that they do not help novices learn about design. For future studies we recommend that researchers use case studies that focus upon some key patterns, and seek to id- ntify the impact that their use can have upon maintenance.

We suggest that these challenges can be addressed by using evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) and its primary tool of systematic literature reviews (SLRs). This paper aims to assess the educational and scientific value of undergraduate and postgraduate students undertaking a specific form of SLR called a mapping study. Using a case study methodology, we asked three postgraduate students and three undergraduates and their supervisor to complete a questionnaire concerning the educational value of mapping studies and any problems they experienced. Students found undertaking a mapping study to be a valuable experience providing both reusable research skills and a good overview of a research topic. Postgraduates found it useful as a starting point for their studies. Undergraduates reported problems undertaking the study in the required timescales. Searching and classifying the literature was difficult.

D, [2015-07-23T21:31:21.019671 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context: There has been an increase in research into global software development (GSD) and in the number of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) addressing this topic. Objective: The aim of this research is to catalogue GSD SLRs in order to identify the topics covered, the active researchers, the publication vehicles, and to assess the quality of the SLRs identified. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs dealing with GSD. We differentiate between SLR studies and papers reporting those studies. Data relating to each of the following was extracted and synthesized from each study: authors and their affiliation at the time of publication, the journal or conference in which the paper was published, the quality of each study and the main GSD study topic. Results: Twenty-four GSD SLR studies and 37 papers reporting those studies were identified. Major GSD topics covered include: (1) organizational environment, (2) project execution, and (3) project planning and control. The main research groups are based in Brazil (17), Ireland (8), and Sweden (7). Conclusions: GSD SLR studies are most frequently reported in the International Conference on Global Software Engineering and IEEE Software; the two most popular topics for research are risk factors due to the organizational environment and the development process. The most active researchers are based in Brazil. The quality of the SLR studies has not changed over time.

We used a participant-observer multi-case embedded case study. Our two cases were a tertiary study of systematic literature reviews published between January 2004 and June 2007 based on a manual search of selected journals and conferences and a replication of that study based on a broad automated search. Broad searches find more papers than restricted searches, but the papers may be of poor quality. Researchers undertaking SLRs may be justified in using targeted manual searches if they intend to omit low quality papers; if publication bias is not an issue; or if they are assessing research trends in research methodologies.

D, [2015-07-23T21:31:21.342279 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Software quality requirements (SQR) play a central role in software quality (SQ) success. The importance of mastering SQR can be seen as obvious, however, when it comes to customer satisfaction, end-users are often dissatisfied with SQ. In this paper, a systematic mapping study aims to summarize SQR research by answering nine mapping questions. In total, 51 articles were selected and classified according to multiple criteria: publication source, publication year, research type, research approach, contribution type of SQR literature, requirements engineering activity, well-known SQ model, software artifact and SQR type. The results show an increased interest in SQR research in recent years and reveal that conferences are the main SQR publication target. Most SQR research has used case studies. The dominant contribution type of SQR research is method while specification is the main requirements engineering activity identified. SQ models need to be more used for SQR identification. Design module and requirements documentation are the principal artifacts reported in SQR literature. External and internal SQR were the main SQR types addressed in literature. Identifying empirical solutions to address SQR is a promising research direction for researchers.

D, [2015-07-23T21:31:21.454361 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: BACKGROUND-The systematic review is becoming a more commonly employed research instrument in empirical software engineering. Before undue reliance is placed on the outcomes of such reviews it would seem useful to consider the robustness of the approach in this particular research context. OBJECTIVE-The aim of this study is to assess the reliability of systematic reviews as a research instrument. In particular, we wish to investigate the consistency of process and the stability of outcomes. METHOD-We compare the results of two independent reviews undertaken with a common research question. RESULTS-The two reviews find similar answers to the research question, although the means of arriving at those answers vary. CONCLUSIONS-In addressing a well-bounded research question, groups of researchers with similar domain experience can arrive at the same review outcomes, even though they may do so in different ways. This provides evidence that, in this context at least, the systematic review is a robust research method.

D, [2015-07-23T21:31:21.621385 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Software evolution is recognized as one of the most challenging areas in the field of Software Engineering. The observation of evolution is time-dependent, reducing opportunities for actual observations in short periods of time. Usually, maintenance cycles are proportional to the software life cycle. Therefore, the amount of research has not been enough to deal with all the issues related to the evolution of software. However, simulation through confident models represents an interesting strategy to support software decay observation in short period of time. Towards that, this paper describes a model aimed at supporting the software decay simulation through systems dynamics. The Laws of Software Evolution and ISO 9126 were used as initial knowledge to support the discovery of software characteristic (size, periodicity, complexity, effort, reliability, and maintainability) relationships. Next, evidence to strengthen the existence of such relationships was acquired through quasi-systematic literature reviews. In sequence, the model was applied to support the simulation of industrial software decay. The results suggested its feasibility and correctness, making it an interesting candidate to support future software decay studies.

D, [2015-07-23T21:31:21.755572 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context: We have been undertaking a series of case studies to investigate the value of mapping (scoping) studies in software engineering. Our previous studies have assessed these using the subjective opinions of researchers. Objective: In order to provide a more objective assessment of value, for this study, we used the results of a systematic mapping study to investigate how well mapping studies identify clusters of related studies and to what extent such clusters are complete. Method: In this participant-observer case study, we undertook a mapping study of unit testing and regression testing empirical studies, which we compared with a previous expert literature review and with six other mapping studies and systematic literature reviews (SLRs) that addressed overlapping topics. Results: Our mapping study found more clusters than the expert literature review although it benefited from the set of studies identified by the expert review when refining our search process. The set of studies found by our searches were less complete than those found by SLRs addressing more specific topics, although we found some studies missed by those SLRs. Conclusions: Researchers undertaking systematic reviews and mapping studies should make use of related systematic reviews and mapping studies to identify known studies in order to refine search strings and validate search results. For completeness and traceability, mapping studies should keep a record of all multiple reports of a single study. Meta-analyses and other systematic literature reviews undertaking detailed aggregation should report on candidate primary studies that were rejected in the final screening process, as well as candidate studies that were included. This helps ensure the repeatability of aggregation results.

D, [2015-07-23T21:31:21.878446 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background--By leveraging cloud services, organizations can deploy their software systems over a pool of resources. However, organizations heavily depend on their business-critical systems, which have been developed over long periods. These legacy applications are usually deployed on-premise. In recent years, research in cloud migration has been carried out. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate this research. Objective--This paper aims to identify, taxonomically classify, and systematically compare existing research on cloud migration. Method--We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 23 selected studies, published from 2010 to 2013. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework that we also introduce in this paper. Results--The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of current solutions for legacy-to-cloud migration. This review also identifies research gaps and directions for future research. Conclusion--This review reveals that cloud migration research is still in early stages of maturity, but is advancing. It identifies the needs for a migration framework to help improving the maturity level and consequently trust into cloud migration. This review shows a lack of tool support to automate migration tasks. This study also identifies needs for architectural adaptation and self-adaptive cloud-enabled systems.

D, [2015-07-23T21:31:22.045638 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) have been gaining significant attention from software engineering researchers since 2004. Several researchers have reported their experiences of and lessons learned from applying systematic reviews to different subject matters in software engineering. However, there has been no attempt at independently exploring experiences and perceptions of the practitioners of systematic reviews in order to gain an in-depth understanding of various aspects of systemic reviews as a new research methodology in software engineering. We assert that there is a need of evidence based body of knowledge about the application of systematic reviews in software engineering. To address this need, we have started an empirical research program that aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge about systematic reviews in software engineering. This paper reports the design, logistics, and results of the first phase empirical study carried out in this program. The results provide interesting insights into different aspects of systematic reviews based on the analysis of the data gathered from 17 interviewees with varying levels of knowledge of and experiences in systematic reviews. The findings from this study are expected to contribute to the existing knowledge about using systematic reviews and help further improve the state-of-the-practice of this research methodology in software engineering.

D, [2015-07-23T21:31:22.203515 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: There has been a growing interest in the role of theory within Software Engineering (SE) research. For several decades, researchers within the SE research community have argued that, to become a real engineering science, SE needs to develop stronger theoretical foundations. A few authors have proposed guidelines for constructing theories, building on insights from other disciplines. However, so far, much SE research is not guided by explicit theory, nor does it produce explicit theory. In this paper we argue that SE research does, in fact, show traces of theory, which we call theory fragments. We have adapted an analytical framework from the social sciences, named the Validity Network Schema (VNS), that we use to illustrate the role of theorizing in SE research. We illustrate the use of this framework by dissecting three well known research papers, each of which has had significant impact on their respective subdisciplines. We conclude this paper by outlining a number of implications for future SE research, and show how by increasing awareness and training, development of SE theories can be improved.

D, [2015-07-23T21:31:22.337907 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) is difficult and time-consuming for an experienced researcher, and even more so for a novice graduate student. With a better understanding of the most common difficulties in the SLR process, mentors will be better prepared to guide novices through the process. This understanding will help researchers have more realistic expectations of the SLR process and will help mentors guide novices through its planning, execution, and documentation phases. Consequently, the objectives of this work are to identify the most difficult and time-consuming phases of the SLR process. Using data from two sources - 52 responses to an online survey sent to all authors of SLRs published in software engineering venues and qualitative experience reports from 8 PhD students who conducted SLRs as part of a course - we identified specific difficulties related to each phase of the SLR process. Our findings highlight the importance of planning, teamwork, and mentoring by an experienced researcher throughout the process. The paper also identifies implications for the teaching of the SLR process.

Of all these, our research line is focused on designing the specific training that members of virtual teams must receive. Universities and companies therefore need to design training schemas to deal with the specifics of GSD, which are principally related to communication difficulties and time and cultural differences. In this work we present the findings of a Systematic Literature Review in the field of GSD training and teaching. Our intention is twofold: on the one hand we wish to discover the existing strategies and proposals available up to the present day, and on the other hand we wish to identify the open challenges, that will be helpful for practitioners and researchers in the future.

D, [2015-07-23T21:31:22.593505 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Process simulation has become a powerful technology in support of software project management and process improvement over the past decades. This research, inspired by the Impact Project, intends to investigate the technology transfer of software process simulation to the use in industrial settings, and further identify the best practices to release its full potential in software practice. We collected the reported applications of process simulation in software industry, and identified its wide adoption in the organizations delivering various software intensive systems. This paper, as an initial report of the research, briefs a historical perspective of the impact upon practice based on the documented evidence, and also elaborates the research-practice transition by examining one detailed case study. It is shown that research has a significant impact on practice in this area. The analysis of impact trace also reveals that the success of software process simulation in practice highly relies on the association with other software process techniques or practices and the close collaboration between researchers and practitioners.

D, [2015-07-23T21:31:22.727548 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Through the use of semi structured interviews with medical device software organizations it emerged that medica device software organizations are experiencing difficulties when following plan driven Software Development Life Cycles (SDLC) particularly in the area of requirements management. To attempt to resolve these issues an examination of the non-regulated industry was performed to determine if lessons learned there could be applied to the development of medical device software This examination revealed that agile methods are being widely adopted in the non-regulated software industry. To learn if agile methods could be adopted when developing medical device software a mapping study was performed which looked for instances of where agile methods have been used in regulated industries and where they have been adopted, to what success This mapping study revealed that incorporating agile practices with the existing plan driven SDLC is the most favourable choice for medical device software organizations. This research aims to develop a SDLC which has a foundation of a plan driven SDLC which incorporates agile practices which can be followed when developing regulatory compliant software.

Method-A previously conducted systematic review (Sulayman and Mendes, 2009) has been updated and extended to identify the current state of research on the mentioned topic. Results Eight studies applied SPI techniques or models to small and medium Web companies. The selected studies did not suggest any customized model or technique to measure the SPI of small and medium Web companies. The characteristics of some small and medium companies such as tight budget constraints, tight deadlines and a short term strategy were also identified. The measures of success for small and medium Web companies, as per SR results, include development team and client satisfaction, increase in productivity, compliance with standards and overall operational excellence. Conclusions-The results of this review, like our previously conducted systematic review (Sulayman and Mendes, 2009), show that very few studies have specifically focused on SPI for Web companies, despite the large number of existing Web companies worldwide, and the even larger number of Web applications being currently developed. This clearly indicates a research gap in this area, with numerous avenues for future work.

D, [2015-07-23T21:31:22.994487 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context: Software systems are increasingly required to operate in an open world, characterized by continuous changes in the environment and in the prescribed requirements. Architecture-centric software evolution (ACSE) is considered as an approach to support software adaptation at a controllable level of abstraction in order to survive in the uncertain environment. This requires evolution in system structure and behavior that can be modeled, analyzed and evolved in a formal fashion. Existing research and practices comprise a wide spectrum of evolution-centric approaches in terms of formalisms, methods, processes and frameworks to tackle ACSE as well as empirical studies to consolidate existing research. However, there is no unified framework providing systematic insight into classification and comparison of state-of-the-art in ACSE research. Objective: We present a taxonomic scheme for a classification and comparison of existing ACSE research approaches, leading to a reflection on areas of future research. Method: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR), resulting in 4138 papers searched and 60 peer-reviewed papers considered for data collection. We populated the taxonomic scheme based on a quantitative and qualitative extraction of data items from the included studies. Results: We identified five main classification categories: (i) type of evolution, (ii) type of specification, (iii) type of architectural reasoning, (iv) runtime issues, and (v) tool support. The selected studies are compared based on their claims and supporting evidences through the scheme. Conclusion: The classification scheme provides a critical view of different aspects to be considered when addressing specific ACSE problems. Besides, the consolidation of the ACSE evidences reflects current trends and the needs for future research directions.

D, [2015-07-23T21:31:23.128114 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper documents a case study of using the 5W+1H model for reporting systematic literature review on software testing for cloud computing. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review that applies the 5W+1H model, which is widely used in the journalism domain, to report the full picture of the research area in both software engineering and services computing. Existing guidelines on systematic literature review heavily rely on the researcher to pose the right research questions, and the review results are tightly focused on these research questions. For researchers new to a field, defining the right research questions that are effective in revealing the critical issues in the field can be challenging. Our case study demonstrates that the 5W+1H model provides an easy aid for the researcher to get over such initial challenges. As the researcher becomes more familiar with the field, he/she may then refine the research questions by adding more topic-specific contexts. In this way, the 5W+1H model serves to provide an exploratory framework to shape a systematic literature review. Applying to software testing for cloud computing, we are able to synthesize a comprehensive picture of recent researches on the field, including publication pattern, article citation immediacy, research topic diversity, research ideas for addressing testing challenges at different cloud service architectural layers. Based on the case study, we summarize the lessons learned on using the 5W+1H model in reporting systematic literature review.

It first appeared in the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference as means to overcome the software crisis. This study aims to investigate how the Software engineering area is evolving, by analyzing the 24 editions of Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES), and understanding which is the impact of international research in this event. A scoping study was performed to figure out how the SE area is evolving and if it suffers influences from international research. We found 512 studies over the 24 SBES editions, which were analyzed and discussed. Based on the analysis, we observed that in the first years there were a few empirical studies; most of them were of theoretical nature. The industry participation and interest still continuous over the editions. Regarding to international impact, we did not find any relation with international research. Our findings suggest that greater attention should be given to the Software Engineering area, with the aim to attract research from industry with real data, and also international collaboration.

D, [2015-07-23T21:31:23.439799 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background: A systematic literature review (SLR) is a methodology used to aggregate all relevant existing evidence to answer a research question of interest. Although crucial, the process used to select primary studies can be arduous, time consuming, and must often be conducted manually. Objective: We propose a novel approach, known as 'Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM, to support the primary study selection activity using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. Method: We conducted a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach. To enable the comparison, we also developed a VTM tool that implemented our approach. We hypothesized that students using SLR-VTM would present improved selection performance and effectiveness. Results: Our results show that incorporating VTM in the SLR study selection activity reduced the time spent in this activity and also increased the number of studies correctly included. Conclusions: Our pilot case study presents promising results suggesting that the use of VTM may indeed be beneficial during the study selection activity when performing an SLR.

This study investigates the effectiveness of using robots as tools in the teaching of introductory programming and to determine whether such technology can help to overcome the current barriers for learners in this context. The systematic literature review (SLR) methodology is used to address this aim. Nine electronic databases, the proceedings from six conferences and two journals were searched for relevant literature and exclusion criteria, and after performing several validation exercises, in total, 75% of included papers report that robots are an effective teaching tool and can help novice programmers in their studies. Most of these papers focus on the use of physical robots, however, and further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of using simulated robots.

Method: A mapping study was performed using an automated search strategy plus snowballing to locate relevant papers. A set of known papers was used to validate the search string. Results: 14 papers were accepted into the final set. Eight presented text mining tools and six discussed the use of visualisation techniques. The stage most commonly targeted was study selection. Only two papers reported an independent evaluation of the tool presented. The majority were evaluated through small experiments and examples of their use. Conclusions: A variety of tools are available to support the SLR process although many are in the early stages of development and usage.

OBJECTIVE-This paper aims to identify and characterize evaluation strategies and measurements used to assess the impact of different SPI initiatives. METHOD-The systematic literature review includes 148 papers published between 1991 and 2008. The selected papers were classified according to SPI initiative, applied evaluation strategies, and measurement perspectives. Potential confounding factors interfering with the evaluation of the improvement effort were assessed. RESULTS-Seven distinct evaluation strategies were identified, wherein the most common one, “Pre-Post Comparison,” was applied in 49 percent of the inspected papers. Quality was the most measured attribute (62 percent), followed by Cost (41 percent), and Schedule (18 percent). Looking at measurement perspectives, “Project” represents the majority with 66 percent. CONCLUSION-The evaluation validity of SPI initiatives is challenged by the scarce consideration of potential confounding factors, particularly given that “Pre-Post Comparison” was identified as the most common evaluation strategy, and the inaccurate descriptions of the evaluation context. Measurements to assess the short and mid-term impact of SPI initiatives prevail, whereas long-term measurements in terms of customer satisfaction and return on investment tend to be less used.

Objective: We investigate how the context of models, the independent variables used, and the modeling techniques applied influence the performance of fault prediction models. Method: We used a systematic literature review to identify 208 fault prediction studies published from January 2000 to December 2010. We synthesize the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modeling techniques such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models that perform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance. Although there are a set of fault prediction studies in which confidence is possible, more studies are needed that use a reliable methodology and which report their context, methodology, and performance comprehensively.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:33.234430 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Distributed Software Development (DSD) emerged from the need to achieve geographically distant customers and currently, allows organizations have global customers and other benefits. This scenario has given rise to new Software Engineering challenges resulting from DSD particularities. Several Systematic Reviews were conducted to address these new challenges. The objective of this paper is to categorize systematic reviews conducted in DSD context. We used the systematic review method to identify SLRs (Systematic Literature Reviews) that address DSD aspects. This study is categorized as a tertiary review. Of fourteen SLRs, seven address aspects of managing distributed development. Four SLRs addressed topics of engineering process. The three remaining are related to Requirements, Design and Software Engineering Education in DSD. The topic areas covered by SLRs are limited, where the majority are focused on summarize the current knowledge concerning a research question. Despite the number of SLRs, the amount of empirical studies is relatively small.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:33.346180 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context. Although research in software engineering largely seeks to improve the practices and products of software development, many practices are based upon codification of expert knowledge, often with little or no underpinning from objective empirical evidence. Software design patterns seek to codify expert knowledge to share experience about successful design structures. Objectives. To investigate how extensively the use of software design patterns has been subjected to empirical study and what evidence is available about how and when their use can provide an effective mechanism for knowledge transfer about design. Method. We conducted a systematic literature review in the form of a mapping study, searching the literature up to the end of 2009 to identify relevant primary studies about the use of the 23 patterns catalogued in the widely referenced book by the “Gang of Four.” These studies were then categorized according to the forms of study employed, the patterns that were studied, as well as the context within which the study took place. Results. Our searches identified 611 candidate papers. Applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria resulted in a final set of 10 papers that described 11 instances of “formal” experimental studies of object-oriented design patterns. We augmented our analysis by including seven “experience” reports that described application of patterns using less rigorous observational forms. We report and review the profiles of the empirical evidence for those patterns for which multiple studies exist. Conclusions. We could not identify firm support for any of the claims made for patterns in general, although there was some support for the usefulness of patterns in providing a framework for maintenance, and some qualitative indication that they do not help novices learn about design. For future studies we recommend that researchers use case studies that focus upon some key patterns, and seek to id- ntify the impact that their use can have upon maintenance.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:33.490920 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: We identify three challenges related to the provenance of the material we use in teaching software engineering. We suggest that these challenges can be addressed by using evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) and its primary tool of systematic literature reviews (SLRs). This paper aims to assess the educational and scientific value of undergraduate and postgraduate students undertaking a specific form of SLR called a mapping study. Using a case study methodology, we asked three postgraduate students and three undergraduates and their supervisor to complete a questionnaire concerning the educational value of mapping studies and any problems they experienced. Students found undertaking a mapping study to be a valuable experience providing both reusable research skills and a good overview of a research topic. Postgraduates found it useful as a starting point for their studies. Undergraduates reported problems undertaking the study in the required timescales. Searching and classifying the literature was difficult.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:33.602234 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context: There has been an increase in research into global software development (GSD) and in the number of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) addressing this topic. Objective: The aim of this research is to catalogue GSD SLRs in order to identify the topics covered, the active researchers, the publication vehicles, and to assess the quality of the SLRs identified. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs dealing with GSD. We differentiate between SLR studies and papers reporting those studies. Data relating to each of the following was extracted and synthesized from each study: authors and their affiliation at the time of publication, the journal or conference in which the paper was published, the quality of each study and the main GSD study topic. Results: Twenty-four GSD SLR studies and 37 papers reporting those studies were identified. Major GSD topics covered include: (1) organizational environment, (2) project execution, and (3) project planning and control. The main research groups are based in Brazil (17), Ireland (8), and Sweden (7). Conclusions: GSD SLR studies are most frequently reported in the International Conference on Global Software Engineering and IEEE Software; the two most popular topics for research are risk factors due to the organizational environment and the development process. The most active researchers are based in Brazil. The quality of the SLR studies has not changed over time.

We used a participant-observer multi-case embedded case study. Our two cases were a tertiary study of systematic literature reviews published between January 2004 and June 2007 based on a manual search of selected journals and conferences and a replication of that study based on a broad automated search. Broad searches find more papers than restricted searches, but the papers may be of poor quality. Researchers undertaking SLRs may be justified in using targeted manual searches if they intend to omit low quality papers; if publication bias is not an issue; or if they are assessing research trends in research methodologies.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:33.859007 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Software quality requirements (SQR) play a central role in software quality (SQ) success. The importance of mastering SQR can be seen as obvious, however, when it comes to customer satisfaction, end-users are often dissatisfied with SQ. In this paper, a systematic mapping study aims to summarize SQR research by answering nine mapping questions. In total, 51 articles were selected and classified according to multiple criteria: publication source, publication year, research type, research approach, contribution type of SQR literature, requirements engineering activity, well-known SQ model, software artifact and SQR type. The results show an increased interest in SQR research in recent years and reveal that conferences are the main SQR publication target. Most SQR research has used case studies. The dominant contribution type of SQR research is method while specification is the main requirements engineering activity identified. SQ models need to be more used for SQR identification. Design module and requirements documentation are the principal artifacts reported in SQR literature. External and internal SQR were the main SQR types addressed in literature. Identifying empirical solutions to address SQR is a promising research direction for researchers.

Before undue reliance is placed on the outcomes of such reviews it would seem useful to consider the robustness of the approach in this particular research context. OBJECTIVE-The aim of this study is to assess the reliability of systematic reviews as a research instrument. In particular, we wish to investigate the consistency of process and the stability of outcomes. METHOD-We compare the results of two independent reviews undertaken with a common research question. RESULTS-The two reviews find similar answers to the research question, although the means of arriving at those answers vary. CONCLUSIONS-In addressing a well-bounded research question, groups of researchers with similar domain experience can arrive at the same review outcomes, even though they may do so in different ways. This provides evidence that, in this context at least, the systematic review is a robust research method.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:34.082070 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Software evolution is recognized as one of the most challenging areas in the field of Software Engineering. The observation of evolution is time-dependent, reducing opportunities for actual observations in short periods of time. Usually, maintenance cycles are proportional to the software life cycle. Therefore, the amount of research has not been enough to deal with all the issues related to the evolution of software. However, simulation through confident models represents an interesting strategy to support software decay observation in short period of time. Towards that, this paper describes a model aimed at supporting the software decay simulation through systems dynamics. The Laws of Software Evolution and ISO 9126 were used as initial knowledge to support the discovery of software characteristic (size, periodicity, complexity, effort, reliability, and maintainability) relationships. Next, evidence to strengthen the existence of such relationships was acquired through quasi-systematic literature reviews. In sequence, the model was applied to support the simulation of industrial software decay. The results suggested its feasibility and correctness, making it an interesting candidate to support future software decay studies.

Our previous studies have assessed these using the subjective opinions of researchers. Objective: In order to provide a more objective assessment of value, for this study, we used the results of a systematic mapping study to investigate how well mapping studies identify clusters of related studies and to what extent such clusters are complete. Method: In this participant-observer case study, we undertook a mapping study of unit testing and regression testing empirical studies, which we compared with a previous expert literature review and with six other mapping studies and systematic literature reviews (SLRs) that addressed overlapping topics. Results: Our mapping study found more clusters than the expert literature review although it benefited from the set of studies identified by the expert review when refining our search process. The set of studies found by our searches were less complete than those found by SLRs addressing more specific topics, although we found some studies missed by those SLRs. Conclusions: Researchers undertaking systematic reviews and mapping studies should make use of related systematic reviews and mapping studies to identify known studies in order to refine search strings and validate search results. For completeness and traceability, mapping studies should keep a record of all multiple reports of a single study. Meta-analyses and other systematic literature reviews undertaking detailed aggregation should report on candidate primary studies that were rejected in the final screening process, as well as candidate studies that were included. This helps ensure the repeatability of aggregation results.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:34.350715 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background--By leveraging cloud services, organizations can deploy their software systems over a pool of resources. However, organizations heavily depend on their business-critical systems, which have been developed over long periods. These legacy applications are usually deployed on-premise. In recent years, research in cloud migration has been carried out. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate this research. Objective--This paper aims to identify, taxonomically classify, and systematically compare existing research on cloud migration. Method--We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 23 selected studies, published from 2010 to 2013. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework that we also introduce in this paper. Results--The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of current solutions for legacy-to-cloud migration. This review also identifies research gaps and directions for future research. Conclusion--This review reveals that cloud migration research is still in early stages of maturity, but is advancing. It identifies the needs for a migration framework to help improving the maturity level and consequently trust into cloud migration. This review shows a lack of tool support to automate migration tasks. This study also identifies needs for architectural adaptation and self-adaptive cloud-enabled systems.

We assert that there is a need of evidence based body of knowledge about the application of systematic reviews in software engineering. To address this need, we have started an empirical research program that aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge about systematic reviews in software engineering. This paper reports the design, logistics, and results of the first phase empirical study carried out in this program. The results provide interesting insights into different aspects of systematic reviews based on the analysis of the data gathered from 17 interviewees with varying levels of knowledge of and experiences in systematic reviews. The findings from this study are expected to contribute to the existing knowledge about using systematic reviews and help further improve the state-of-the-practice of this research methodology in software engineering.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:34.784072 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: There has been a growing interest in the role of theory within Software Engineering (SE) research. For several decades, researchers within the SE research community have argued that, to become a real engineering science, SE needs to develop stronger theoretical foundations. A few authors have proposed guidelines for constructing theories, building on insights from other disciplines. However, so far, much SE research is not guided by explicit theory, nor does it produce explicit theory. In this paper we argue that SE research does, in fact, show traces of theory, which we call theory fragments. We have adapted an analytical framework from the social sciences, named the Validity Network Schema (VNS), that we use to illustrate the role of theorizing in SE research. We illustrate the use of this framework by dissecting three well known research papers, each of which has had significant impact on their respective subdisciplines. We conclude this paper by outlining a number of implications for future SE research, and show how by increasing awareness and training, development of SE theories can be improved.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:34.939956 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) is difficult and time-consuming for an experienced researcher, and even more so for a novice graduate student. With a better understanding of the most common difficulties in the SLR process, mentors will be better prepared to guide novices through the process. This understanding will help researchers have more realistic expectations of the SLR process and will help mentors guide novices through its planning, execution, and documentation phases. Consequently, the objectives of this work are to identify the most difficult and time-consuming phases of the SLR process. Using data from two sources - 52 responses to an online survey sent to all authors of SLRs published in software engineering venues and qualitative experience reports from 8 PhD students who conducted SLRs as part of a course - we identified specific difficulties related to each phase of the SLR process. Our findings highlight the importance of planning, teamwork, and mentoring by an experienced researcher throughout the process. The paper also identifies implications for the teaching of the SLR process.

Of all these, our research line is focused on designing the specific training that members of virtual teams must receive. Universities and companies therefore need to design training schemas to deal with the specifics of GSD, which are principally related to communication difficulties and time and cultural differences. In this work we present the findings of a Systematic Literature Review in the field of GSD training and teaching. Our intention is twofold: on the one hand we wish to discover the existing strategies and proposals available up to the present day, and on the other hand we wish to identify the open challenges, that will be helpful for practitioners and researchers in the future.

This research, inspired by the Impact Project, intends to investigate the technology transfer of software process simulation to the use in industrial settings, and further identify the best practices to release its full potential in software practice. We collected the reported applications of process simulation in software industry, and identified its wide adoption in the organizations delivering various software intensive systems. This paper, as an initial report of the research, briefs a historical perspective of the impact upon practice based on the documented evidence, and also elaborates the research-practice transition by examining one detailed case study. It is shown that research has a significant impact on practice in this area. The analysis of impact trace also reveals that the success of software process simulation in practice highly relies on the association with other software process techniques or practices and the close collaboration between researchers and practitioners.

To attempt to resolve these issues an examination of the non-regulated industry was performed to determine if lessons learned there could be applied to the development of medical device software This examination revealed that agile methods are being widely adopted in the non-regulated software industry. To learn if agile methods could be adopted when developing medical device software a mapping study was performed which looked for instances of where agile methods have been used in regulated industries and where they have been adopted, to what success This mapping study revealed that incorporating agile practices with the existing plan driven SDLC is the most favourable choice for medical device software organizations. This research aims to develop a SDLC which has a foundation of a plan driven SDLC which incorporates agile practices which can be followed when developing regulatory compliant software.

Method-A previously conducted systematic review (Sulayman and Mendes, 2009) has been updated and extended to identify the current state of research on the mentioned topic. Results Eight studies applied SPI techniques or models to small and medium Web companies. The selected studies did not suggest any customized model or technique to measure the SPI of small and medium Web companies. The characteristics of some small and medium companies such as tight budget constraints, tight deadlines and a short term strategy were also identified. The measures of success for small and medium Web companies, as per SR results, include development team and client satisfaction, increase in productivity, compliance with standards and overall operational excellence. Conclusions-The results of this review, like our previously conducted systematic review (Sulayman and Mendes, 2009), show that very few studies have specifically focused on SPI for Web companies, despite the large number of existing Web companies worldwide, and the even larger number of Web applications being currently developed. This clearly indicates a research gap in this area, with numerous avenues for future work.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:35.586176 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context: Software systems are increasingly required to operate in an open world, characterized by continuous changes in the environment and in the prescribed requirements. Architecture-centric software evolution (ACSE) is considered as an approach to support software adaptation at a controllable level of abstraction in order to survive in the uncertain environment. This requires evolution in system structure and behavior that can be modeled, analyzed and evolved in a formal fashion. Existing research and practices comprise a wide spectrum of evolution-centric approaches in terms of formalisms, methods, processes and frameworks to tackle ACSE as well as empirical studies to consolidate existing research. However, there is no unified framework providing systematic insight into classification and comparison of state-of-the-art in ACSE research. Objective: We present a taxonomic scheme for a classification and comparison of existing ACSE research approaches, leading to a reflection on areas of future research. Method: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR), resulting in 4138 papers searched and 60 peer-reviewed papers considered for data collection. We populated the taxonomic scheme based on a quantitative and qualitative extraction of data items from the included studies. Results: We identified five main classification categories: (i) type of evolution, (ii) type of specification, (iii) type of architectural reasoning, (iv) runtime issues, and (v) tool support. The selected studies are compared based on their claims and supporting evidences through the scheme. Conclusion: The classification scheme provides a critical view of different aspects to be considered when addressing specific ACSE problems. Besides, the consolidation of the ACSE evidences reflects current trends and the needs for future research directions.

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review that applies the 5W+1H model, which is widely used in the journalism domain, to report the full picture of the research area in both software engineering and services computing. Existing guidelines on systematic literature review heavily rely on the researcher to pose the right research questions, and the review results are tightly focused on these research questions. For researchers new to a field, defining the right research questions that are effective in revealing the critical issues in the field can be challenging. Our case study demonstrates that the 5W+1H model provides an easy aid for the researcher to get over such initial challenges. As the researcher becomes more familiar with the field, he/she may then refine the research questions by adding more topic-specific contexts. In this way, the 5W+1H model serves to provide an exploratory framework to shape a systematic literature review. Applying to software testing for cloud computing, we are able to synthesize a comprehensive picture of recent researches on the field, including publication pattern, article citation immediacy, research topic diversity, research ideas for addressing testing challenges at different cloud service architectural layers. Based on the case study, we summarize the lessons learned on using the 5W+1H model in reporting systematic literature review.

It first appeared in the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference as means to overcome the software crisis. This study aims to investigate how the Software engineering area is evolving, by analyzing the 24 editions of Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES), and understanding which is the impact of international research in this event. A scoping study was performed to figure out how the SE area is evolving and if it suffers influences from international research. We found 512 studies over the 24 SBES editions, which were analyzed and discussed. Based on the analysis, we observed that in the first years there were a few empirical studies; most of them were of theoretical nature. The industry participation and interest still continuous over the editions. Regarding to international impact, we did not find any relation with international research. Our findings suggest that greater attention should be given to the Software Engineering area, with the aim to attract research from industry with real data, and also international collaboration.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:35.920675 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background: A systematic literature review (SLR) is a methodology used to aggregate all relevant existing evidence to answer a research question of interest. Although crucial, the process used to select primary studies can be arduous, time consuming, and must often be conducted manually. Objective: We propose a novel approach, known as 'Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM, to support the primary study selection activity using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. Method: We conducted a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach. To enable the comparison, we also developed a VTM tool that implemented our approach. We hypothesized that students using SLR-VTM would present improved selection performance and effectiveness. Results: Our results show that incorporating VTM in the SLR study selection activity reduced the time spent in this activity and also increased the number of studies correctly included. Conclusions: Our pilot case study presents promising results suggesting that the use of VTM may indeed be beneficial during the study selection activity when performing an SLR.

This study investigates the effectiveness of using robots as tools in the teaching of introductory programming and to determine whether such technology can help to overcome the current barriers for learners in this context. The systematic literature review (SLR) methodology is used to address this aim. Nine electronic databases, the proceedings from six conferences and two journals were searched for relevant literature and exclusion criteria, and after performing several validation exercises, in total, 75% of included papers report that robots are an effective teaching tool and can help novice programmers in their studies. Most of these papers focus on the use of physical robots, however, and further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of using simulated robots.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:36.200169 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have become an established methodology in software engineering (SE) research however they can be very time consuming and error prone. Aim: The aims of this study are to identify and classify tools that can help to automate part or all of the SLR process within the SE domain. Method: A mapping study was performed using an automated search strategy plus snowballing to locate relevant papers. A set of known papers was used to validate the search string. Results: 14 papers were accepted into the final set. Eight presented text mining tools and six discussed the use of visualisation techniques. The stage most commonly targeted was study selection. Only two papers reported an independent evaluation of the tool presented. The majority were evaluated through small experiments and examples of their use. Conclusions: A variety of tools are available to support the SLR process although many are in the early stages of development and usage.

OBJECTIVE-This paper aims to identify and characterize evaluation strategies and measurements used to assess the impact of different SPI initiatives. METHOD-The systematic literature review includes 148 papers published between 1991 and 2008. The selected papers were classified according to SPI initiative, applied evaluation strategies, and measurement perspectives. Potential confounding factors interfering with the evaluation of the improvement effort were assessed. RESULTS-Seven distinct evaluation strategies were identified, wherein the most common one, “Pre-Post Comparison,” was applied in 49 percent of the inspected papers. Quality was the most measured attribute (62 percent), followed by Cost (41 percent), and Schedule (18 percent). Looking at measurement perspectives, “Project” represents the majority with 66 percent. CONCLUSION-The evaluation validity of SPI initiatives is challenged by the scarce consideration of potential confounding factors, particularly given that “Pre-Post Comparison” was identified as the most common evaluation strategy, and the inaccurate descriptions of the evaluation context. Measurements to assess the short and mid-term impact of SPI initiatives prevail, whereas long-term measurements in terms of customer satisfaction and return on investment tend to be less used.

Objective: We investigate how the context of models, the independent variables used, and the modeling techniques applied influence the performance of fault prediction models. Method: We used a systematic literature review to identify 208 fault prediction studies published from January 2000 to December 2010. We synthesize the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modeling techniques such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models that perform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance. Although there are a set of fault prediction studies in which confidence is possible, more studies are needed that use a reliable methodology and which report their context, methodology, and performance comprehensively.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:54.290780 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Distributed Software Development (DSD) emerged from the need to achieve geographically distant customers and currently, allows organizations have global customers and other benefits. This scenario has given rise to new Software Engineering challenges resulting from DSD particularities. Several Systematic Reviews were conducted to address these new challenges. The objective of this paper is to categorize systematic reviews conducted in DSD context. We used the systematic review method to identify SLRs (Systematic Literature Reviews) that address DSD aspects. This study is categorized as a tertiary review. Of fourteen SLRs, seven address aspects of managing distributed development. Four SLRs addressed topics of engineering process. The three remaining are related to Requirements, Design and Software Engineering Education in DSD. The topic areas covered by SLRs are limited, where the majority are focused on summarize the current knowledge concerning a research question. Despite the number of SLRs, the amount of empirical studies is relatively small.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:54.424558 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context. Although research in software engineering largely seeks to improve the practices and products of software development, many practices are based upon codification of expert knowledge, often with little or no underpinning from objective empirical evidence. Software design patterns seek to codify expert knowledge to share experience about successful design structures. Objectives. To investigate how extensively the use of software design patterns has been subjected to empirical study and what evidence is available about how and when their use can provide an effective mechanism for knowledge transfer about design. Method. We conducted a systematic literature review in the form of a mapping study, searching the literature up to the end of 2009 to identify relevant primary studies about the use of the 23 patterns catalogued in the widely referenced book by the “Gang of Four.” These studies were then categorized according to the forms of study employed, the patterns that were studied, as well as the context within which the study took place. Results. Our searches identified 611 candidate papers. Applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria resulted in a final set of 10 papers that described 11 instances of “formal” experimental studies of object-oriented design patterns. We augmented our analysis by including seven “experience” reports that described application of patterns using less rigorous observational forms. We report and review the profiles of the empirical evidence for those patterns for which multiple studies exist. Conclusions. We could not identify firm support for any of the claims made for patterns in general, although there was some support for the usefulness of patterns in providing a framework for maintenance, and some qualitative indication that they do not help novices learn about design. For future studies we recommend that researchers use case studies that focus upon some key patterns, and seek to id- ntify the impact that their use can have upon maintenance.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:54.566598 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: We identify three challenges related to the provenance of the material we use in teaching software engineering. We suggest that these challenges can be addressed by using evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) and its primary tool of systematic literature reviews (SLRs). This paper aims to assess the educational and scientific value of undergraduate and postgraduate students undertaking a specific form of SLR called a mapping study. Using a case study methodology, we asked three postgraduate students and three undergraduates and their supervisor to complete a questionnaire concerning the educational value of mapping studies and any problems they experienced. Students found undertaking a mapping study to be a valuable experience providing both reusable research skills and a good overview of a research topic. Postgraduates found it useful as a starting point for their studies. Undergraduates reported problems undertaking the study in the required timescales. Searching and classifying the literature was difficult.

Objective: The aim of this research is to catalogue GSD SLRs in order to identify the topics covered, the active researchers, the publication vehicles, and to assess the quality of the SLRs identified. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs dealing with GSD. We differentiate between SLR studies and papers reporting those studies. Data relating to each of the following was extracted and synthesized from each study: authors and their affiliation at the time of publication, the journal or conference in which the paper was published, the quality of each study and the main GSD study topic. Results: Twenty-four GSD SLR studies and 37 papers reporting those studies were identified. Major GSD topics covered include: (1) organizational environment, (2) project execution, and (3) project planning and control. The main research groups are based in Brazil (17), Ireland (8), and Sweden (7). Conclusions: GSD SLR studies are most frequently reported in the International Conference on Global Software Engineering and IEEE Software; the two most popular topics for research are risk factors due to the organizational environment and the development process. The most active researchers are based in Brazil. The quality of the SLR studies has not changed over time.

We used a participant-observer multi-case embedded case study. Our two cases were a tertiary study of systematic literature reviews published between January 2004 and June 2007 based on a manual search of selected journals and conferences and a replication of that study based on a broad automated search. Broad searches find more papers than restricted searches, but the papers may be of poor quality. Researchers undertaking SLRs may be justified in using targeted manual searches if they intend to omit low quality papers; if publication bias is not an issue; or if they are assessing research trends in research methodologies.

The importance of mastering SQR can be seen as obvious, however, when it comes to customer satisfaction, end-users are often dissatisfied with SQ. In this paper, a systematic mapping study aims to summarize SQR research by answering nine mapping questions. In total, 51 articles were selected and classified according to multiple criteria: publication source, publication year, research type, research approach, contribution type of SQR literature, requirements engineering activity, well-known SQ model, software artifact and SQR type. The results show an increased interest in SQR research in recent years and reveal that conferences are the main SQR publication target. Most SQR research has used case studies. The dominant contribution type of SQR research is method while specification is the main requirements engineering activity identified. SQ models need to be more used for SQR identification. Design module and requirements documentation are the principal artifacts reported in SQR literature. External and internal SQR were the main SQR types addressed in literature. Identifying empirical solutions to address SQR is a promising research direction for researchers.

Before undue reliance is placed on the outcomes of such reviews it would seem useful to consider the robustness of the approach in this particular research context. OBJECTIVE-The aim of this study is to assess the reliability of systematic reviews as a research instrument. In particular, we wish to investigate the consistency of process and the stability of outcomes. METHOD-We compare the results of two independent reviews undertaken with a common research question. RESULTS-The two reviews find similar answers to the research question, although the means of arriving at those answers vary. CONCLUSIONS-In addressing a well-bounded research question, groups of researchers with similar domain experience can arrive at the same review outcomes, even though they may do so in different ways. This provides evidence that, in this context at least, the systematic review is a robust research method.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:55.271349 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Software evolution is recognized as one of the most challenging areas in the field of Software Engineering. The observation of evolution is time-dependent, reducing opportunities for actual observations in short periods of time. Usually, maintenance cycles are proportional to the software life cycle. Therefore, the amount of research has not been enough to deal with all the issues related to the evolution of software. However, simulation through confident models represents an interesting strategy to support software decay observation in short period of time. Towards that, this paper describes a model aimed at supporting the software decay simulation through systems dynamics. The Laws of Software Evolution and ISO 9126 were used as initial knowledge to support the discovery of software characteristic (size, periodicity, complexity, effort, reliability, and maintainability) relationships. Next, evidence to strengthen the existence of such relationships was acquired through quasi-systematic literature reviews. In sequence, the model was applied to support the simulation of industrial software decay. The results suggested its feasibility and correctness, making it an interesting candidate to support future software decay studies.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:55.382752 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context: We have been undertaking a series of case studies to investigate the value of mapping (scoping) studies in software engineering. Our previous studies have assessed these using the subjective opinions of researchers. Objective: In order to provide a more objective assessment of value, for this study, we used the results of a systematic mapping study to investigate how well mapping studies identify clusters of related studies and to what extent such clusters are complete. Method: In this participant-observer case study, we undertook a mapping study of unit testing and regression testing empirical studies, which we compared with a previous expert literature review and with six other mapping studies and systematic literature reviews (SLRs) that addressed overlapping topics. Results: Our mapping study found more clusters than the expert literature review although it benefited from the set of studies identified by the expert review when refining our search process. The set of studies found by our searches were less complete than those found by SLRs addressing more specific topics, although we found some studies missed by those SLRs. Conclusions: Researchers undertaking systematic reviews and mapping studies should make use of related systematic reviews and mapping studies to identify known studies in order to refine search strings and validate search results. For completeness and traceability, mapping studies should keep a record of all multiple reports of a single study. Meta-analyses and other systematic literature reviews undertaking detailed aggregation should report on candidate primary studies that were rejected in the final screening process, as well as candidate studies that were included. This helps ensure the repeatability of aggregation results.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:55.516719 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background--By leveraging cloud services, organizations can deploy their software systems over a pool of resources. However, organizations heavily depend on their business-critical systems, which have been developed over long periods. These legacy applications are usually deployed on-premise. In recent years, research in cloud migration has been carried out. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate this research. Objective--This paper aims to identify, taxonomically classify, and systematically compare existing research on cloud migration. Method--We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 23 selected studies, published from 2010 to 2013. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework that we also introduce in this paper. Results--The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of current solutions for legacy-to-cloud migration. This review also identifies research gaps and directions for future research. Conclusion--This review reveals that cloud migration research is still in early stages of maturity, but is advancing. It identifies the needs for a migration framework to help improving the maturity level and consequently trust into cloud migration. This review shows a lack of tool support to automate migration tasks. This study also identifies needs for architectural adaptation and self-adaptive cloud-enabled systems.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:55.661029 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) have been gaining significant attention from software engineering researchers since 2004. Several researchers have reported their experiences of and lessons learned from applying systematic reviews to different subject matters in software engineering. However, there has been no attempt at independently exploring experiences and perceptions of the practitioners of systematic reviews in order to gain an in-depth understanding of various aspects of systemic reviews as a new research methodology in software engineering. We assert that there is a need of evidence based body of knowledge about the application of systematic reviews in software engineering. To address this need, we have started an empirical research program that aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge about systematic reviews in software engineering. This paper reports the design, logistics, and results of the first phase empirical study carried out in this program. The results provide interesting insights into different aspects of systematic reviews based on the analysis of the data gathered from 17 interviewees with varying levels of knowledge of and experiences in systematic reviews. The findings from this study are expected to contribute to the existing knowledge about using systematic reviews and help further improve the state-of-the-practice of this research methodology in software engineering.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:55.806817 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: There has been a growing interest in the role of theory within Software Engineering (SE) research. For several decades, researchers within the SE research community have argued that, to become a real engineering science, SE needs to develop stronger theoretical foundations. A few authors have proposed guidelines for constructing theories, building on insights from other disciplines. However, so far, much SE research is not guided by explicit theory, nor does it produce explicit theory. In this paper we argue that SE research does, in fact, show traces of theory, which we call theory fragments. We have adapted an analytical framework from the social sciences, named the Validity Network Schema (VNS), that we use to illustrate the role of theorizing in SE research. We illustrate the use of this framework by dissecting three well known research papers, each of which has had significant impact on their respective subdisciplines. We conclude this paper by outlining a number of implications for future SE research, and show how by increasing awareness and training, development of SE theories can be improved.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:55.940427 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) is difficult and time-consuming for an experienced researcher, and even more so for a novice graduate student. With a better understanding of the most common difficulties in the SLR process, mentors will be better prepared to guide novices through the process. This understanding will help researchers have more realistic expectations of the SLR process and will help mentors guide novices through its planning, execution, and documentation phases. Consequently, the objectives of this work are to identify the most difficult and time-consuming phases of the SLR process. Using data from two sources - 52 responses to an online survey sent to all authors of SLRs published in software engineering venues and qualitative experience reports from 8 PhD students who conducted SLRs as part of a course - we identified specific difficulties related to each phase of the SLR process. Our findings highlight the importance of planning, teamwork, and mentoring by an experienced researcher throughout the process. The paper also identifies implications for the teaching of the SLR process.

Universities and companies therefore need to design training schemas to deal with the specifics of GSD, which are principally related to communication difficulties and time and cultural differences. In this work we present the findings of a Systematic Literature Review in the field of GSD training and teaching. Our intention is twofold: on the one hand we wish to discover the existing strategies and proposals available up to the present day, and on the other hand we wish to identify the open challenges, that will be helpful for practitioners and researchers in the future.

This research, inspired by the Impact Project, intends to investigate the technology transfer of software process simulation to the use in industrial settings, and further identify the best practices to release its full potential in software practice. We collected the reported applications of process simulation in software industry, and identified its wide adoption in the organizations delivering various software intensive systems. This paper, as an initial report of the research, briefs a historical perspective of the impact upon practice based on the documented evidence, and also elaborates the research-practice transition by examining one detailed case study. It is shown that research has a significant impact on practice in this area. The analysis of impact trace also reveals that the success of software process simulation in practice highly relies on the association with other software process techniques or practices and the close collaboration between researchers and practitioners.

To attempt to resolve these issues an examination of the non-regulated industry was performed to determine if lessons learned there could be applied to the development of medical device software This examination revealed that agile methods are being widely adopted in the non-regulated software industry. To learn if agile methods could be adopted when developing medical device software a mapping study was performed which looked for instances of where agile methods have been used in regulated industries and where they have been adopted, to what success This mapping study revealed that incorporating agile practices with the existing plan driven SDLC is the most favourable choice for medical device software organizations. This research aims to develop a SDLC which has a foundation of a plan driven SDLC which incorporates agile practices which can be followed when developing regulatory compliant software.

Method-A previously conducted systematic review (Sulayman and Mendes, 2009) has been updated and extended to identify the current state of research on the mentioned topic. Results Eight studies applied SPI techniques or models to small and medium Web companies. The selected studies did not suggest any customized model or technique to measure the SPI of small and medium Web companies. The characteristics of some small and medium companies such as tight budget constraints, tight deadlines and a short term strategy were also identified. The measures of success for small and medium Web companies, as per SR results, include development team and client satisfaction, increase in productivity, compliance with standards and overall operational excellence. Conclusions-The results of this review, like our previously conducted systematic review (Sulayman and Mendes, 2009), show that very few studies have specifically focused on SPI for Web companies, despite the large number of existing Web companies worldwide, and the even larger number of Web applications being currently developed. This clearly indicates a research gap in this area, with numerous avenues for future work.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:56.565419 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context: Software systems are increasingly required to operate in an open world, characterized by continuous changes in the environment and in the prescribed requirements. Architecture-centric software evolution (ACSE) is considered as an approach to support software adaptation at a controllable level of abstraction in order to survive in the uncertain environment. This requires evolution in system structure and behavior that can be modeled, analyzed and evolved in a formal fashion. Existing research and practices comprise a wide spectrum of evolution-centric approaches in terms of formalisms, methods, processes and frameworks to tackle ACSE as well as empirical studies to consolidate existing research. However, there is no unified framework providing systematic insight into classification and comparison of state-of-the-art in ACSE research. Objective: We present a taxonomic scheme for a classification and comparison of existing ACSE research approaches, leading to a reflection on areas of future research. Method: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR), resulting in 4138 papers searched and 60 peer-reviewed papers considered for data collection. We populated the taxonomic scheme based on a quantitative and qualitative extraction of data items from the included studies. Results: We identified five main classification categories: (i) type of evolution, (ii) type of specification, (iii) type of architectural reasoning, (iv) runtime issues, and (v) tool support. The selected studies are compared based on their claims and supporting evidences through the scheme. Conclusion: The classification scheme provides a critical view of different aspects to be considered when addressing specific ACSE problems. Besides, the consolidation of the ACSE evidences reflects current trends and the needs for future research directions.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:56.699159 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper documents a case study of using the 5W+1H model for reporting systematic literature review on software testing for cloud computing. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review that applies the 5W+1H model, which is widely used in the journalism domain, to report the full picture of the research area in both software engineering and services computing. Existing guidelines on systematic literature review heavily rely on the researcher to pose the right research questions, and the review results are tightly focused on these research questions. For researchers new to a field, defining the right research questions that are effective in revealing the critical issues in the field can be challenging. Our case study demonstrates that the 5W+1H model provides an easy aid for the researcher to get over such initial challenges. As the researcher becomes more familiar with the field, he/she may then refine the research questions by adding more topic-specific contexts. In this way, the 5W+1H model serves to provide an exploratory framework to shape a systematic literature review. Applying to software testing for cloud computing, we are able to synthesize a comprehensive picture of recent researches on the field, including publication pattern, article citation immediacy, research topic diversity, research ideas for addressing testing challenges at different cloud service architectural layers. Based on the case study, we summarize the lessons learned on using the 5W+1H model in reporting systematic literature review.

It first appeared in the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference as means to overcome the software crisis. This study aims to investigate how the Software engineering area is evolving, by analyzing the 24 editions of Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES), and understanding which is the impact of international research in this event. A scoping study was performed to figure out how the SE area is evolving and if it suffers influences from international research. We found 512 studies over the 24 SBES editions, which were analyzed and discussed. Based on the analysis, we observed that in the first years there were a few empirical studies; most of them were of theoretical nature. The industry participation and interest still continuous over the editions. Regarding to international impact, we did not find any relation with international research. Our findings suggest that greater attention should be given to the Software Engineering area, with the aim to attract research from industry with real data, and also international collaboration.

D, [2015-07-23T21:32:56.955202 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background: A systematic literature review (SLR) is a methodology used to aggregate all relevant existing evidence to answer a research question of interest. Although crucial, the process used to select primary studies can be arduous, time consuming, and must often be conducted manually. Objective: We propose a novel approach, known as 'Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM, to support the primary study selection activity using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. Method: We conducted a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach. To enable the comparison, we also developed a VTM tool that implemented our approach. We hypothesized that students using SLR-VTM would present improved selection performance and effectiveness. Results: Our results show that incorporating VTM in the SLR study selection activity reduced the time spent in this activity and also increased the number of studies correctly included. Conclusions: Our pilot case study presents promising results suggesting that the use of VTM may indeed be beneficial during the study selection activity when performing an SLR.

This study investigates the effectiveness of using robots as tools in the teaching of introductory programming and to determine whether such technology can help to overcome the current barriers for learners in this context. The systematic literature review (SLR) methodology is used to address this aim. Nine electronic databases, the proceedings from six conferences and two journals were searched for relevant literature and exclusion criteria, and after performing several validation exercises, in total, 75% of included papers report that robots are an effective teaching tool and can help novice programmers in their studies. Most of these papers focus on the use of physical robots, however, and further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of using simulated robots.

Aim: The aims of this study are to identify and classify tools that can help to automate part or all of the SLR process within the SE domain. Method: A mapping study was performed using an automated search strategy plus snowballing to locate relevant papers. A set of known papers was used to validate the search string. Results: 14 papers were accepted into the final set. Eight presented text mining tools and six discussed the use of visualisation techniques. The stage most commonly targeted was study selection. Only two papers reported an independent evaluation of the tool presented. The majority were evaluated through small experiments and examples of their use. Conclusions: A variety of tools are available to support the SLR process although many are in the early stages of development and usage.

D, [2015-07-23T21:33:31.842456 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: BACKGROUND-Software Process Improvement (SPI) is a systematic approach to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of a software development organization and to enhance software products. OBJECTIVE-This paper aims to identify and characterize evaluation strategies and measurements used to assess the impact of different SPI initiatives. METHOD-The systematic literature review includes 148 papers published between 1991 and 2008. The selected papers were classified according to SPI initiative, applied evaluation strategies, and measurement perspectives. Potential confounding factors interfering with the evaluation of the improvement effort were assessed. RESULTS-Seven distinct evaluation strategies were identified, wherein the most common one, “Pre-Post Comparison,” was applied in 49 percent of the inspected papers. Quality was the most measured attribute (62 percent), followed by Cost (41 percent), and Schedule (18 percent). Looking at measurement perspectives, “Project” represents the majority with 66 percent. CONCLUSION-The evaluation validity of SPI initiatives is challenged by the scarce consideration of potential confounding factors, particularly given that “Pre-Post Comparison” was identified as the most common evaluation strategy, and the inaccurate descriptions of the evaluation context. Measurements to assess the short and mid-term impact of SPI initiatives prevail, whereas long-term measurements in terms of customer satisfaction and return on investment tend to be less used.

Objective: We investigate how the context of models, the independent variables used, and the modeling techniques applied influence the performance of fault prediction models. Method: We used a systematic literature review to identify 208 fault prediction studies published from January 2000 to December 2010. We synthesize the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modeling techniques such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models that perform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance. Although there are a set of fault prediction studies in which confidence is possible, more studies are needed that use a reliable methodology and which report their context, methodology, and performance comprehensively.

This scenario has given rise to new Software Engineering challenges resulting from DSD particularities. Several Systematic Reviews were conducted to address these new challenges. The objective of this paper is to categorize systematic reviews conducted in DSD context. We used the systematic review method to identify SLRs (Systematic Literature Reviews) that address DSD aspects. This study is categorized as a tertiary review. Of fourteen SLRs, seven address aspects of managing distributed development. Four SLRs addressed topics of engineering process. The three remaining are related to Requirements, Design and Software Engineering Education in DSD. The topic areas covered by SLRs are limited, where the majority are focused on summarize the current knowledge concerning a research question. Despite the number of SLRs, the amount of empirical studies is relatively small.

D, [2015-07-23T21:33:32.265949 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context. Although research in software engineering largely seeks to improve the practices and products of software development, many practices are based upon codification of expert knowledge, often with little or no underpinning from objective empirical evidence. Software design patterns seek to codify expert knowledge to share experience about successful design structures. Objectives. To investigate how extensively the use of software design patterns has been subjected to empirical study and what evidence is available about how and when their use can provide an effective mechanism for knowledge transfer about design. Method. We conducted a systematic literature review in the form of a mapping study, searching the literature up to the end of 2009 to identify relevant primary studies about the use of the 23 patterns catalogued in the widely referenced book by the “Gang of Four.” These studies were then categorized according to the forms of study employed, the patterns that were studied, as well as the context within which the study took place. Results. Our searches identified 611 candidate papers. Applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria resulted in a final set of 10 papers that described 11 instances of “formal” experimental studies of object-oriented design patterns. We augmented our analysis by including seven “experience” reports that described application of patterns using less rigorous observational forms. We report and review the profiles of the empirical evidence for those patterns for which multiple studies exist. Conclusions. We could not identify firm support for any of the claims made for patterns in general, although there was some support for the usefulness of patterns in providing a framework for maintenance, and some qualitative indication that they do not help novices learn about design. For future studies we recommend that researchers use case studies that focus upon some key patterns, and seek to id- ntify the impact that their use can have upon maintenance.

We suggest that these challenges can be addressed by using evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) and its primary tool of systematic literature reviews (SLRs). This paper aims to assess the educational and scientific value of undergraduate and postgraduate students undertaking a specific form of SLR called a mapping study. Using a case study methodology, we asked three postgraduate students and three undergraduates and their supervisor to complete a questionnaire concerning the educational value of mapping studies and any problems they experienced. Students found undertaking a mapping study to be a valuable experience providing both reusable research skills and a good overview of a research topic. Postgraduates found it useful as a starting point for their studies. Undergraduates reported problems undertaking the study in the required timescales. Searching and classifying the literature was difficult.

Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs dealing with GSD. We differentiate between SLR studies and papers reporting those studies. Data relating to each of the following was extracted and synthesized from each study: authors and their affiliation at the time of publication, the journal or conference in which the paper was published, the quality of each study and the main GSD study topic. Results: Twenty-four GSD SLR studies and 37 papers reporting those studies were identified. Major GSD topics covered include: (1) organizational environment, (2) project execution, and (3) project planning and control. The main research groups are based in Brazil (17), Ireland (8), and Sweden (7). Conclusions: GSD SLR studies are most frequently reported in the International Conference on Global Software Engineering and IEEE Software; the two most popular topics for research are risk factors due to the organizational environment and the development process. The most active researchers are based in Brazil. The quality of the SLR studies has not changed over time.

We used a participant-observer multi-case embedded case study. Our two cases were a tertiary study of systematic literature reviews published between January 2004 and June 2007 based on a manual search of selected journals and conferences and a replication of that study based on a broad automated search. Broad searches find more papers than restricted searches, but the papers may be of poor quality. Researchers undertaking SLRs may be justified in using targeted manual searches if they intend to omit low quality papers; if publication bias is not an issue; or if they are assessing research trends in research methodologies.

D, [2015-07-23T21:33:32.734225 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Software quality requirements (SQR) play a central role in software quality (SQ) success. The importance of mastering SQR can be seen as obvious, however, when it comes to customer satisfaction, end-users are often dissatisfied with SQ. In this paper, a systematic mapping study aims to summarize SQR research by answering nine mapping questions. In total, 51 articles were selected and classified according to multiple criteria: publication source, publication year, research type, research approach, contribution type of SQR literature, requirements engineering activity, well-known SQ model, software artifact and SQR type. The results show an increased interest in SQR research in recent years and reveal that conferences are the main SQR publication target. Most SQR research has used case studies. The dominant contribution type of SQR research is method while specification is the main requirements engineering activity identified. SQ models need to be more used for SQR identification. Design module and requirements documentation are the principal artifacts reported in SQR literature. External and internal SQR were the main SQR types addressed in literature. Identifying empirical solutions to address SQR is a promising research direction for researchers.

D, [2015-07-23T21:33:32.878436 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: BACKGROUND-The systematic review is becoming a more commonly employed research instrument in empirical software engineering. Before undue reliance is placed on the outcomes of such reviews it would seem useful to consider the robustness of the approach in this particular research context. OBJECTIVE-The aim of this study is to assess the reliability of systematic reviews as a research instrument. In particular, we wish to investigate the consistency of process and the stability of outcomes. METHOD-We compare the results of two independent reviews undertaken with a common research question. RESULTS-The two reviews find similar answers to the research question, although the means of arriving at those answers vary. CONCLUSIONS-In addressing a well-bounded research question, groups of researchers with similar domain experience can arrive at the same review outcomes, even though they may do so in different ways. This provides evidence that, in this context at least, the systematic review is a robust research method.

D, [2015-07-23T21:33:32.990074 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Software evolution is recognized as one of the most challenging areas in the field of Software Engineering. The observation of evolution is time-dependent, reducing opportunities for actual observations in short periods of time. Usually, maintenance cycles are proportional to the software life cycle. Therefore, the amount of research has not been enough to deal with all the issues related to the evolution of software. However, simulation through confident models represents an interesting strategy to support software decay observation in short period of time. Towards that, this paper describes a model aimed at supporting the software decay simulation through systems dynamics. The Laws of Software Evolution and ISO 9126 were used as initial knowledge to support the discovery of software characteristic (size, periodicity, complexity, effort, reliability, and maintainability) relationships. Next, evidence to strengthen the existence of such relationships was acquired through quasi-systematic literature reviews. In sequence, the model was applied to support the simulation of industrial software decay. The results suggested its feasibility and correctness, making it an interesting candidate to support future software decay studies.

D, [2015-07-23T21:33:33.101612 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context: We have been undertaking a series of case studies to investigate the value of mapping (scoping) studies in software engineering. Our previous studies have assessed these using the subjective opinions of researchers. Objective: In order to provide a more objective assessment of value, for this study, we used the results of a systematic mapping study to investigate how well mapping studies identify clusters of related studies and to what extent such clusters are complete. Method: In this participant-observer case study, we undertook a mapping study of unit testing and regression testing empirical studies, which we compared with a previous expert literature review and with six other mapping studies and systematic literature reviews (SLRs) that addressed overlapping topics. Results: Our mapping study found more clusters than the expert literature review although it benefited from the set of studies identified by the expert review when refining our search process. The set of studies found by our searches were less complete than those found by SLRs addressing more specific topics, although we found some studies missed by those SLRs. Conclusions: Researchers undertaking systematic reviews and mapping studies should make use of related systematic reviews and mapping studies to identify known studies in order to refine search strings and validate search results. For completeness and traceability, mapping studies should keep a record of all multiple reports of a single study. Meta-analyses and other systematic literature reviews undertaking detailed aggregation should report on candidate primary studies that were rejected in the final screening process, as well as candidate studies that were included. This helps ensure the repeatability of aggregation results.

D, [2015-07-23T21:33:33.235177 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background--By leveraging cloud services, organizations can deploy their software systems over a pool of resources. However, organizations heavily depend on their business-critical systems, which have been developed over long periods. These legacy applications are usually deployed on-premise. In recent years, research in cloud migration has been carried out. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate this research. Objective--This paper aims to identify, taxonomically classify, and systematically compare existing research on cloud migration. Method--We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 23 selected studies, published from 2010 to 2013. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework that we also introduce in this paper. Results--The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of current solutions for legacy-to-cloud migration. This review also identifies research gaps and directions for future research. Conclusion--This review reveals that cloud migration research is still in early stages of maturity, but is advancing. It identifies the needs for a migration framework to help improving the maturity level and consequently trust into cloud migration. This review shows a lack of tool support to automate migration tasks. This study also identifies needs for architectural adaptation and self-adaptive cloud-enabled systems.

D, [2015-07-23T21:33:33.370443 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) have been gaining significant attention from software engineering researchers since 2004. Several researchers have reported their experiences of and lessons learned from applying systematic reviews to different subject matters in software engineering. However, there has been no attempt at independently exploring experiences and perceptions of the practitioners of systematic reviews in order to gain an in-depth understanding of various aspects of systemic reviews as a new research methodology in software engineering. We assert that there is a need of evidence based body of knowledge about the application of systematic reviews in software engineering. To address this need, we have started an empirical research program that aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge about systematic reviews in software engineering. This paper reports the design, logistics, and results of the first phase empirical study carried out in this program. The results provide interesting insights into different aspects of systematic reviews based on the analysis of the data gathered from 17 interviewees with varying levels of knowledge of and experiences in systematic reviews. The findings from this study are expected to contribute to the existing knowledge about using systematic reviews and help further improve the state-of-the-practice of this research methodology in software engineering.

D, [2015-07-23T21:33:33.481506 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: There has been a growing interest in the role of theory within Software Engineering (SE) research. For several decades, researchers within the SE research community have argued that, to become a real engineering science, SE needs to develop stronger theoretical foundations. A few authors have proposed guidelines for constructing theories, building on insights from other disciplines. However, so far, much SE research is not guided by explicit theory, nor does it produce explicit theory. In this paper we argue that SE research does, in fact, show traces of theory, which we call theory fragments. We have adapted an analytical framework from the social sciences, named the Validity Network Schema (VNS), that we use to illustrate the role of theorizing in SE research. We illustrate the use of this framework by dissecting three well known research papers, each of which has had significant impact on their respective subdisciplines. We conclude this paper by outlining a number of implications for future SE research, and show how by increasing awareness and training, development of SE theories can be improved.

D, [2015-07-23T21:33:33.615655 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) is difficult and time-consuming for an experienced researcher, and even more so for a novice graduate student. With a better understanding of the most common difficulties in the SLR process, mentors will be better prepared to guide novices through the process. This understanding will help researchers have more realistic expectations of the SLR process and will help mentors guide novices through its planning, execution, and documentation phases. Consequently, the objectives of this work are to identify the most difficult and time-consuming phases of the SLR process. Using data from two sources - 52 responses to an online survey sent to all authors of SLRs published in software engineering venues and qualitative experience reports from 8 PhD students who conducted SLRs as part of a course - we identified specific difficulties related to each phase of the SLR process. Our findings highlight the importance of planning, teamwork, and mentoring by an experienced researcher throughout the process. The paper also identifies implications for the teaching of the SLR process.

Of all these, our research line is focused on designing the specific training that members of virtual teams must receive. Universities and companies therefore need to design training schemas to deal with the specifics of GSD, which are principally related to communication difficulties and time and cultural differences. In this work we present the findings of a Systematic Literature Review in the field of GSD training and teaching. Our intention is twofold: on the one hand we wish to discover the existing strategies and proposals available up to the present day, and on the other hand we wish to identify the open challenges, that will be helpful for practitioners and researchers in the future.

D, [2015-07-23T21:33:33.915906 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Process simulation has become a powerful technology in support of software project management and process improvement over the past decades. This research, inspired by the Impact Project, intends to investigate the technology transfer of software process simulation to the use in industrial settings, and further identify the best practices to release its full potential in software practice. We collected the reported applications of process simulation in software industry, and identified its wide adoption in the organizations delivering various software intensive systems. This paper, as an initial report of the research, briefs a historical perspective of the impact upon practice based on the documented evidence, and also elaborates the research-practice transition by examining one detailed case study. It is shown that research has a significant impact on practice in this area. The analysis of impact trace also reveals that the success of software process simulation in practice highly relies on the association with other software process techniques or practices and the close collaboration between researchers and practitioners.

D, [2015-07-23T21:33:34.027341 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Through the use of semi structured interviews with medical device software organizations it emerged that medica device software organizations are experiencing difficulties when following plan driven Software Development Life Cycles (SDLC) particularly in the area of requirements management. To attempt to resolve these issues an examination of the non-regulated industry was performed to determine if lessons learned there could be applied to the development of medical device software This examination revealed that agile methods are being widely adopted in the non-regulated software industry. To learn if agile methods could be adopted when developing medical device software a mapping study was performed which looked for instances of where agile methods have been used in regulated industries and where they have been adopted, to what success This mapping study revealed that incorporating agile practices with the existing plan driven SDLC is the most favourable choice for medical device software organizations. This research aims to develop a SDLC which has a foundation of a plan driven SDLC which incorporates agile practices which can be followed when developing regulatory compliant software.

Method-A previously conducted systematic review (Sulayman and Mendes, 2009) has been updated and extended to identify the current state of research on the mentioned topic. Results Eight studies applied SPI techniques or models to small and medium Web companies. The selected studies did not suggest any customized model or technique to measure the SPI of small and medium Web companies. The characteristics of some small and medium companies such as tight budget constraints, tight deadlines and a short term strategy were also identified. The measures of success for small and medium Web companies, as per SR results, include development team and client satisfaction, increase in productivity, compliance with standards and overall operational excellence. Conclusions-The results of this review, like our previously conducted systematic review (Sulayman and Mendes, 2009), show that very few studies have specifically focused on SPI for Web companies, despite the large number of existing Web companies worldwide, and the even larger number of Web applications being currently developed. This clearly indicates a research gap in this area, with numerous avenues for future work.

D, [2015-07-23T21:33:34.250719 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context: Software systems are increasingly required to operate in an open world, characterized by continuous changes in the environment and in the prescribed requirements. Architecture-centric software evolution (ACSE) is considered as an approach to support software adaptation at a controllable level of abstraction in order to survive in the uncertain environment. This requires evolution in system structure and behavior that can be modeled, analyzed and evolved in a formal fashion. Existing research and practices comprise a wide spectrum of evolution-centric approaches in terms of formalisms, methods, processes and frameworks to tackle ACSE as well as empirical studies to consolidate existing research. However, there is no unified framework providing systematic insight into classification and comparison of state-of-the-art in ACSE research. Objective: We present a taxonomic scheme for a classification and comparison of existing ACSE research approaches, leading to a reflection on areas of future research. Method: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR), resulting in 4138 papers searched and 60 peer-reviewed papers considered for data collection. We populated the taxonomic scheme based on a quantitative and qualitative extraction of data items from the included studies. Results: We identified five main classification categories: (i) type of evolution, (ii) type of specification, (iii) type of architectural reasoning, (iv) runtime issues, and (v) tool support. The selected studies are compared based on their claims and supporting evidences through the scheme. Conclusion: The classification scheme provides a critical view of different aspects to be considered when addressing specific ACSE problems. Besides, the consolidation of the ACSE evidences reflects current trends and the needs for future research directions.

D, [2015-07-23T21:33:34.384033 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper documents a case study of using the 5W+1H model for reporting systematic literature review on software testing for cloud computing. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review that applies the 5W+1H model, which is widely used in the journalism domain, to report the full picture of the research area in both software engineering and services computing. Existing guidelines on systematic literature review heavily rely on the researcher to pose the right research questions, and the review results are tightly focused on these research questions. For researchers new to a field, defining the right research questions that are effective in revealing the critical issues in the field can be challenging. Our case study demonstrates that the 5W+1H model provides an easy aid for the researcher to get over such initial challenges. As the researcher becomes more familiar with the field, he/she may then refine the research questions by adding more topic-specific contexts. In this way, the 5W+1H model serves to provide an exploratory framework to shape a systematic literature review. Applying to software testing for cloud computing, we are able to synthesize a comprehensive picture of recent researches on the field, including publication pattern, article citation immediacy, research topic diversity, research ideas for addressing testing challenges at different cloud service architectural layers. Based on the case study, we summarize the lessons learned on using the 5W+1H model in reporting systematic literature review.

It first appeared in the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference as means to overcome the software crisis. This study aims to investigate how the Software engineering area is evolving, by analyzing the 24 editions of Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES), and understanding which is the impact of international research in this event. A scoping study was performed to figure out how the SE area is evolving and if it suffers influences from international research. We found 512 studies over the 24 SBES editions, which were analyzed and discussed. Based on the analysis, we observed that in the first years there were a few empirical studies; most of them were of theoretical nature. The industry participation and interest still continuous over the editions. Regarding to international impact, we did not find any relation with international research. Our findings suggest that greater attention should be given to the Software Engineering area, with the aim to attract research from industry with real data, and also international collaboration.

D, [2015-07-23T21:33:34.685095 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background: A systematic literature review (SLR) is a methodology used to aggregate all relevant existing evidence to answer a research question of interest. Although crucial, the process used to select primary studies can be arduous, time consuming, and must often be conducted manually. Objective: We propose a novel approach, known as 'Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM, to support the primary study selection activity using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. Method: We conducted a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach. To enable the comparison, we also developed a VTM tool that implemented our approach. We hypothesized that students using SLR-VTM would present improved selection performance and effectiveness. Results: Our results show that incorporating VTM in the SLR study selection activity reduced the time spent in this activity and also increased the number of studies correctly included. Conclusions: Our pilot case study presents promising results suggesting that the use of VTM may indeed be beneficial during the study selection activity when performing an SLR.

This study investigates the effectiveness of using robots as tools in the teaching of introductory programming and to determine whether such technology can help to overcome the current barriers for learners in this context. The systematic literature review (SLR) methodology is used to address this aim. Nine electronic databases, the proceedings from six conferences and two journals were searched for relevant literature and exclusion criteria, and after performing several validation exercises, in total, 75% of included papers report that robots are an effective teaching tool and can help novice programmers in their studies. Most of these papers focus on the use of physical robots, however, and further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of using simulated robots.

Aim: The aims of this study are to identify and classify tools that can help to automate part or all of the SLR process within the SE domain. Method: A mapping study was performed using an automated search strategy plus snowballing to locate relevant papers. A set of known papers was used to validate the search string. Results: 14 papers were accepted into the final set. Eight presented text mining tools and six discussed the use of visualisation techniques. The stage most commonly targeted was study selection. Only two papers reported an independent evaluation of the tool presented. The majority were evaluated through small experiments and examples of their use. Conclusions: A variety of tools are available to support the SLR process although many are in the early stages of development and usage.

D, [2015-07-23T21:34:44.246876 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper focuses on the intrinsic aspects of power management for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in HEVs (PHEV). A vehicle power distribution density function is used to describe the drive cycle characteristics. An electric driveline loss is introduced to describe the minimum system loss for a given mechanical power output, and a piecewise linear fuel consumption model is used to capture essential characteristics such as idle fuel consumption rate, peak efficiency, and the minimum power to reach peak efficiency. Models are based on the assumption that both machines operate at the optimal speed and torque for a given mechanical power as if they are coupled with an ideal continuous variable transmission (CVT). The power management strategy is represented with a pair of power parameters that describe the power threshold for turning on the engine and the optimum battery power in engine-on operations. The model of a parallel hybrid electric powertrain is constructed to obtain optimal solutions that maximize the fuel economy for a given battery energy depletion and for a general vehicle power distribution density function. One-dimensional loss models of two power sources as approximations to real machines coupled with hypothetic CVTs are introduced to solve the optimization problem analytically. It is found that the optimal minimum engine power is the controlling factor in minimizing the total fuel consumption for the given battery energy depletion targets and that the optimal power is solely determined by powertrain characteristics. Numerical simulations validated the properties of the optimal power solutions obtained through analytic approaches. The significance of the results to real-world HEV and PHEV applications are also discussed.

D, [2015-07-23T21:34:44.358062 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: These days, the Hybrid Electric vehicles (HEV) are designed for various requirements with varying topologies and control strategies. Design of the drive train components for the desired performance of the vehicle no longer based on different formulae. Fuel economy and emission have become the basic constraint. Automaker has to take care of the road transport policies also before deciding the sizes of the drive train components. Modeling and simulation based design method has been adopted by many researchers and automakers. The sizes of drive train components are optimized for the desired performance of vehicle. NERL ADVISOR is one such vehicle simulation software which is used for sizing of the drive train components of HEV. This paper uses simulation on ADVISOR to size the drive train components of hybrid Electric Vehicle for the desired performance.

D, [2015-07-23T21:34:44.469810 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Beginning in 1990, the major automotive passenger vehicle manufacturers once again re-evaluated the potential of the battery powered electric vehicle (EV). This intensive effort to reduce the battery EV to commercial practice focused attention on the key issue of limited vehicle range, resulting from the low energy density and high mass characteristics of batteries, in comparison to the high energy density of liquid hydrocarbon (HC) fuels. Consequently, by 1995, vehicle manufacturers turned their attention to hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). This redirection of EV effort was highlighted finally in 1997, at the 57th Frankfurt Motor Show, the Audi Duo parallel type hybrid was released for the domestic market as a 1998 model vehicle. Also at the 1997 32nd Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota Hybrid System (THS) Prius was released for the domestic market as a production 1998 model vehicle. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the key features of these two 1998 model year production hybrid systems. Among the conclusions, two issues are evident: one, the major manufacturers have turned to the hybrid concept in their search for solutions to the key EV issues of limited range; and, heating/air conditioning; and two, the focus is now on introducing hybrid EV for test marketing domestically

D, [2015-07-23T21:34:44.581109 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Four light duty gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles (Toyota Prius, Honda Civic, Honda Insight and Ford Escape) were tested over five different driving cycles at two temperatures using chassis dynamometer emissions testing procedures. The vehicles were tested at 20degC and -18degC. Second-by-second gaseous emissions and total particle number emissions from the hybrid vehicles show patterns that are in some ways similar to conventional multiport fuel injected gasoline vehicles, with large increases in concentration on accelerations. Under driving conditions where the engine may be turned off and on, or under conditions where the electric drive assists in accelerations, different patterns are observed. These patterns can also differ from one repeat of a driving cycle to another, depending on the state of charge of the battery. Cold temperature operation is very demanding on the electric system of the hybrids. The batteries are challenged not only in starting the vehicle but in retaining charge during operation. These conditions result in much higher fuel consumption and mass emission rates of pollutants and greenhouse gases as compared to standard temperature operation and also greatly influence the transient nature of emissions from these vehicles.

D, [2015-07-23T21:34:44.958470 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper describes the implementation of a flexible laboratory test bench for developing electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrains in a university environment. The test bench, which is implemented using relatively low-cost off-the-shelf products, is capable of serving a broad variety of purposes ranging from the design and test of propulsion motor drives to the implementation of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) powertrain control strategies. This paper illustrates the test bench capabilities by (a) simulating the Jeep Commander II, a fuel cell sport utility vehicle (SUV) from Daimler-Chrysler, performing the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS), (b) simulating the Prius, a commercially available gasoline-electric hybrid compact car from Toyota, performing the Japanese "10-15 mode" driving schedule, and (c) determining the efficiency map of a three-phase induction motor (IM). Additionally, the test bench could be also used as a dynamic simulator for renewable energy sources such as wind turbine generators.

D, [2015-07-23T21:34:45.092144 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper addresses system design and integration challenges involved in meeting the requirements for coordinated deployment of Intelligent Hybrid Vehicle Systems. A hybrid vehicle can run purely on a gas engine, purely on an electric motor, or a combination of both. Advanced hybrid vehicles are designed to use a vehicle management system that integrates many subsystem functions into one system. However, many recent hybrid vehicles do not focus on the utilization of decision support techniques for the implementation of system design. The decision support design emphasizes a driver-oriented and automatic-oriented drive-by-wire vehicle system. The top-down functional decomposition and bottom-up physical integration design methodologies help to create an augmented functional analysis in the device level software. The significant portions are devoted to introducing the design stages and establishing the hybrid vehicle management system.

Pulse width modulation (PWM) control methods are examined for operating such a plug-in HEV in mobile power generation and vehicle-to-grid support applications to assess their impacts on the power conversion efficiency. A novel unipolar/interleaved PWM switching scheme is proposed, which can significantly reduce the switching losses and substantially increase the efficiency. A dual inverter drive prototype was assembled to test the PWM control schemes and test results are included to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

It has many benefits over its predecessors, which developed power using only fuel. The thought is to design and construct a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) powered by battery as well as petrol. The vehicle is made dynamic in nature by making use of electrical power from battery and fuel power. It consumes less fuel and creates comparatively less pollution as compared to conventional vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles consists of a battery, to drive the electric motor and power system with an IC engine to increase fuel economy reduce harmful emissions from the exhaust. Also there is a provision for recharging the battery using a generator which is run using a turbine, which runs on the exhaust of the IC engine. In HEV, the battery single handedly provides power for driving at low speeds where the efficiency of IC engine is least. In cruising and high load conditions like moving up the hill, the electric power assists the engine by providing additional power. Thus the HEV is the best alternative in areas with high traffic like urban metropolitan cities.

Two operating objectives are identified, one for energy saving and the other for substituting petroleum fuel by electrical energy. The way in which the power train control and component rating can be optimised to meet these particular operating objectives is discussed. In the final part of the paper the performance of the optimised hybrid vehicles are compared with both IC engine and electric vehicles and the petroleum substitution design is shown to warrant further development.

D, [2015-07-23T21:34:46.230124 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Assuming the availability of a high energy and power density battery of 100 Wh/lb and 100 W/lb by the 1980' s, the energy consumption and efficiency of electric and heat engine cars are compared on an equal basis. This is achieved by considering a reference electric car of 3150-lb weight similar in body construction, aerodynamics, and rolling resistance to a conventional heat engine car of equal weight, and comparing the performance of the two cars over the same driving modes. The reference electric car is then used as a baseline to evaluate the possible improvements in future electric cars. The energy consumption for an optimized 2000-lb electric car of driving range, comfort, and performance comparable to a conventional car is estimated. Assuming a gradual growth in electric car population leading to their widespread use by the 1990's, the impact on electric power generation and distribution systems is estimated. Though the analysis is based on a high energy and power density battery the results may be extrapolated to electric cars using lower performance batteries. It is noted that batteries with lower energy density can provide sufficient driving range to fulfill a significant portion of our transportation needs and their continued development and improvement will accelerate the achievement of the high energy-density goal [1].

D, [2015-07-23T21:34:46.954120 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: The application of batteries and ultracapacitors in electric energy storage units for battery powered (EV) and charge sustaining and plug-in hybrid-electric (HEV and PHEV) vehicles have been studied in detail. The use of IC engines and hydrogen fuel cells as the primary energy converters for the hybrid vehicles was considered. The study focused on the use of lithium-ion batteries and carbon/carbon ultracapacitors as the energy storage technologies most likely to be used in future vehicles. The key findings of the study are as follows. 1) The energy density and power density characteristics of both battery and ultracapacitor technologies are sufficient for the design of attractive EVs, HEVs, and PHEVs. 2) Charge sustaining, engine powered hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) can be designed using either batteries or ultracapacitors with fuel economy improvements of 50% and greater. 3) Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) can be designed with effective all-electric ranges of 30-60 km using lithium-ion batteries that are relatively small. The effective fuel economy of the PHEVs can be very high (greater than 100 mpg) for long daily driving ranges (80-150 km) resulting in a large fraction (greater than 75%) of the energy to power the vehicle being grid electricity. 4) Mild hybrid-electric vehicles (MHEVs) can be designed using ultracapacitors having an energy storage capacity of 75-150 Wh. The fuel economy improvement with the ultracapacitors is 10%-15% higher than with the same weight of batteries due to the higher efficiency of the ultracapacitors and more efficient engine operation. 5) Hybrid-electric vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells can use either batteries or ultracapacitors for energy storage. Simulation results indicate the equivalent fuel economy of the fuel cell powered vehicles is 2-3 times higher than that of a gasoline fueled IC vehicle of the same weight and road load. Compared to an engine-powered HEV, the equivalent fuel economy of the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle wou- - ld be 1.66-2.0 times higher

The analytical approach is based on the energy balance equations, whereas the simulation approach is based on an accurate and fast forward-facing simulation model for simulating parallel and series hybrid powertrains. A very good agreement between simulation and analytical results gives confidence pertaining to the accuracy of the performed analysis and confirms the validity of the analytical framework. Thus, combined simulation and analytical analysis enables deep insight into the energy conversion phenomena in hybrid powertrains and reveals the advantages and disadvantages of both hybrid concepts running under different operating conditions. It is obvious from the presented results that the parallel hybrid powertrain features better fuel economy than the series one for the applied test cycles, whereas both hybrid powertrain concepts feature the best fuel economy at light-duty application.

Designing a hybrid drive train is a multiobjective design problem. The main design objectives are fuel consumption, emissions, and performance. However, it is difficult to find a global optimal integral design solution due to the interdependence of design choices (parameters) regarding the drive-train topology, component sizes, component technologies, and control strategy, as well as the unknown sensitivity of the design objectives to the design parameters. In this paper, a parametric optimization procedure is presented to solve the design problem, where the main design objective is fuel consumption. The effects of parameter variation on fuel consumption have been investigated. Furthermore, a reduced hybrid drive-train model is introduced, with which the effects of design parameter variation is very quickly studied with an average error of less than 1.6%.

Now, several auto manufacturers are preparing for the commercial launches of battery powered electric vehicles in 2011. Another battle for dominance in electric car market has started. However, the development of technologies for electric cars has a very long history and presently there is a huge diversity of technological solutions in development. In order to understand the evolution of electric vehicles, we carried out two related case studies. In the first case study, we analyze the experience of General Motors in the last 40 years in developing electric vehicles. Our focuses are on the objectives of each development, technologies employed and external factors that stimulated each effort. The results show that in the first 20 years the main objective is to explore different technologies. The intention to launch a commercial electric vehicle only appears in the last 20 years. In the second case study, we analyze propulsion technologies and product architectures electric vehicles announced, in the last few years, by established auto manufacturers and new entrants. The results show that innovations in product architecture can provide a niche market for electric vehicles.

OBJECTIVE-This paper aims to identify and characterize evaluation strategies and measurements used to assess the impact of different SPI initiatives. METHOD-The systematic literature review includes 148 papers published between 1991 and 2008. The selected papers were classified according to SPI initiative, applied evaluation strategies, and measurement perspectives. Potential confounding factors interfering with the evaluation of the improvement effort were assessed. RESULTS-Seven distinct evaluation strategies were identified, wherein the most common one, “Pre-Post Comparison,” was applied in 49 percent of the inspected papers. Quality was the most measured attribute (62 percent), followed by Cost (41 percent), and Schedule (18 percent). Looking at measurement perspectives, “Project” represents the majority with 66 percent. CONCLUSION-The evaluation validity of SPI initiatives is challenged by the scarce consideration of potential confounding factors, particularly given that “Pre-Post Comparison” was identified as the most common evaluation strategy, and the inaccurate descriptions of the evaluation context. Measurements to assess the short and mid-term impact of SPI initiatives prevail, whereas long-term measurements in terms of customer satisfaction and return on investment tend to be less used.

Objective: We investigate how the context of models, the independent variables used, and the modeling techniques applied influence the performance of fault prediction models. Method: We used a systematic literature review to identify 208 fault prediction studies published from January 2000 to December 2010. We synthesize the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modeling techniques such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models that perform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance. Although there are a set of fault prediction studies in which confidence is possible, more studies are needed that use a reliable methodology and which report their context, methodology, and performance comprehensively.

D, [2015-07-23T21:35:43.431085 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Distributed Software Development (DSD) emerged from the need to achieve geographically distant customers and currently, allows organizations have global customers and other benefits. This scenario has given rise to new Software Engineering challenges resulting from DSD particularities. Several Systematic Reviews were conducted to address these new challenges. The objective of this paper is to categorize systematic reviews conducted in DSD context. We used the systematic review method to identify SLRs (Systematic Literature Reviews) that address DSD aspects. This study is categorized as a tertiary review. Of fourteen SLRs, seven address aspects of managing distributed development. Four SLRs addressed topics of engineering process. The three remaining are related to Requirements, Design and Software Engineering Education in DSD. The topic areas covered by SLRs are limited, where the majority are focused on summarize the current knowledge concerning a research question. Despite the number of SLRs, the amount of empirical studies is relatively small.

D, [2015-07-23T21:35:43.587077 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context. Although research in software engineering largely seeks to improve the practices and products of software development, many practices are based upon codification of expert knowledge, often with little or no underpinning from objective empirical evidence. Software design patterns seek to codify expert knowledge to share experience about successful design structures. Objectives. To investigate how extensively the use of software design patterns has been subjected to empirical study and what evidence is available about how and when their use can provide an effective mechanism for knowledge transfer about design. Method. We conducted a systematic literature review in the form of a mapping study, searching the literature up to the end of 2009 to identify relevant primary studies about the use of the 23 patterns catalogued in the widely referenced book by the “Gang of Four.” These studies were then categorized according to the forms of study employed, the patterns that were studied, as well as the context within which the study took place. Results. Our searches identified 611 candidate papers. Applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria resulted in a final set of 10 papers that described 11 instances of “formal” experimental studies of object-oriented design patterns. We augmented our analysis by including seven “experience” reports that described application of patterns using less rigorous observational forms. We report and review the profiles of the empirical evidence for those patterns for which multiple studies exist. Conclusions. We could not identify firm support for any of the claims made for patterns in general, although there was some support for the usefulness of patterns in providing a framework for maintenance, and some qualitative indication that they do not help novices learn about design. For future studies we recommend that researchers use case studies that focus upon some key patterns, and seek to id- ntify the impact that their use can have upon maintenance.

We suggest that these challenges can be addressed by using evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) and its primary tool of systematic literature reviews (SLRs). This paper aims to assess the educational and scientific value of undergraduate and postgraduate students undertaking a specific form of SLR called a mapping study. Using a case study methodology, we asked three postgraduate students and three undergraduates and their supervisor to complete a questionnaire concerning the educational value of mapping studies and any problems they experienced. Students found undertaking a mapping study to be a valuable experience providing both reusable research skills and a good overview of a research topic. Postgraduates found it useful as a starting point for their studies. Undergraduates reported problems undertaking the study in the required timescales. Searching and classifying the literature was difficult.

Objective: The aim of this research is to catalogue GSD SLRs in order to identify the topics covered, the active researchers, the publication vehicles, and to assess the quality of the SLRs identified. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs dealing with GSD. We differentiate between SLR studies and papers reporting those studies. Data relating to each of the following was extracted and synthesized from each study: authors and their affiliation at the time of publication, the journal or conference in which the paper was published, the quality of each study and the main GSD study topic. Results: Twenty-four GSD SLR studies and 37 papers reporting those studies were identified. Major GSD topics covered include: (1) organizational environment, (2) project execution, and (3) project planning and control. The main research groups are based in Brazil (17), Ireland (8), and Sweden (7). Conclusions: GSD SLR studies are most frequently reported in the International Conference on Global Software Engineering and IEEE Software; the two most popular topics for research are risk factors due to the organizational environment and the development process. The most active researchers are based in Brazil. The quality of the SLR studies has not changed over time.

We used a participant-observer multi-case embedded case study. Our two cases were a tertiary study of systematic literature reviews published between January 2004 and June 2007 based on a manual search of selected journals and conferences and a replication of that study based on a broad automated search. Broad searches find more papers than restricted searches, but the papers may be of poor quality. Researchers undertaking SLRs may be justified in using targeted manual searches if they intend to omit low quality papers; if publication bias is not an issue; or if they are assessing research trends in research methodologies.

The importance of mastering SQR can be seen as obvious, however, when it comes to customer satisfaction, end-users are often dissatisfied with SQ. In this paper, a systematic mapping study aims to summarize SQR research by answering nine mapping questions. In total, 51 articles were selected and classified according to multiple criteria: publication source, publication year, research type, research approach, contribution type of SQR literature, requirements engineering activity, well-known SQ model, software artifact and SQR type. The results show an increased interest in SQR research in recent years and reveal that conferences are the main SQR publication target. Most SQR research has used case studies. The dominant contribution type of SQR research is method while specification is the main requirements engineering activity identified. SQ models need to be more used for SQR identification. Design module and requirements documentation are the principal artifacts reported in SQR literature. External and internal SQR were the main SQR types addressed in literature. Identifying empirical solutions to address SQR is a promising research direction for researchers.

Before undue reliance is placed on the outcomes of such reviews it would seem useful to consider the robustness of the approach in this particular research context. OBJECTIVE-The aim of this study is to assess the reliability of systematic reviews as a research instrument. In particular, we wish to investigate the consistency of process and the stability of outcomes. METHOD-We compare the results of two independent reviews undertaken with a common research question. RESULTS-The two reviews find similar answers to the research question, although the means of arriving at those answers vary. CONCLUSIONS-In addressing a well-bounded research question, groups of researchers with similar domain experience can arrive at the same review outcomes, even though they may do so in different ways. This provides evidence that, in this context at least, the systematic review is a robust research method.

D, [2015-07-23T21:35:44.434832 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Software evolution is recognized as one of the most challenging areas in the field of Software Engineering. The observation of evolution is time-dependent, reducing opportunities for actual observations in short periods of time. Usually, maintenance cycles are proportional to the software life cycle. Therefore, the amount of research has not been enough to deal with all the issues related to the evolution of software. However, simulation through confident models represents an interesting strategy to support software decay observation in short period of time. Towards that, this paper describes a model aimed at supporting the software decay simulation through systems dynamics. The Laws of Software Evolution and ISO 9126 were used as initial knowledge to support the discovery of software characteristic (size, periodicity, complexity, effort, reliability, and maintainability) relationships. Next, evidence to strengthen the existence of such relationships was acquired through quasi-systematic literature reviews. In sequence, the model was applied to support the simulation of industrial software decay. The results suggested its feasibility and correctness, making it an interesting candidate to support future software decay studies.

Our previous studies have assessed these using the subjective opinions of researchers. Objective: In order to provide a more objective assessment of value, for this study, we used the results of a systematic mapping study to investigate how well mapping studies identify clusters of related studies and to what extent such clusters are complete. Method: In this participant-observer case study, we undertook a mapping study of unit testing and regression testing empirical studies, which we compared with a previous expert literature review and with six other mapping studies and systematic literature reviews (SLRs) that addressed overlapping topics. Results: Our mapping study found more clusters than the expert literature review although it benefited from the set of studies identified by the expert review when refining our search process. The set of studies found by our searches were less complete than those found by SLRs addressing more specific topics, although we found some studies missed by those SLRs. Conclusions: Researchers undertaking systematic reviews and mapping studies should make use of related systematic reviews and mapping studies to identify known studies in order to refine search strings and validate search results. For completeness and traceability, mapping studies should keep a record of all multiple reports of a single study. Meta-analyses and other systematic literature reviews undertaking detailed aggregation should report on candidate primary studies that were rejected in the final screening process, as well as candidate studies that were included. This helps ensure the repeatability of aggregation results.

D, [2015-07-23T21:35:44.703757 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background--By leveraging cloud services, organizations can deploy their software systems over a pool of resources. However, organizations heavily depend on their business-critical systems, which have been developed over long periods. These legacy applications are usually deployed on-premise. In recent years, research in cloud migration has been carried out. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate this research. Objective--This paper aims to identify, taxonomically classify, and systematically compare existing research on cloud migration. Method--We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 23 selected studies, published from 2010 to 2013. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework that we also introduce in this paper. Results--The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of current solutions for legacy-to-cloud migration. This review also identifies research gaps and directions for future research. Conclusion--This review reveals that cloud migration research is still in early stages of maturity, but is advancing. It identifies the needs for a migration framework to help improving the maturity level and consequently trust into cloud migration. This review shows a lack of tool support to automate migration tasks. This study also identifies needs for architectural adaptation and self-adaptive cloud-enabled systems.

D, [2015-07-23T21:35:44.881937 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) have been gaining significant attention from software engineering researchers since 2004. Several researchers have reported their experiences of and lessons learned from applying systematic reviews to different subject matters in software engineering. However, there has been no attempt at independently exploring experiences and perceptions of the practitioners of systematic reviews in order to gain an in-depth understanding of various aspects of systemic reviews as a new research methodology in software engineering. We assert that there is a need of evidence based body of knowledge about the application of systematic reviews in software engineering. To address this need, we have started an empirical research program that aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge about systematic reviews in software engineering. This paper reports the design, logistics, and results of the first phase empirical study carried out in this program. The results provide interesting insights into different aspects of systematic reviews based on the analysis of the data gathered from 17 interviewees with varying levels of knowledge of and experiences in systematic reviews. The findings from this study are expected to contribute to the existing knowledge about using systematic reviews and help further improve the state-of-the-practice of this research methodology in software engineering.

D, [2015-07-23T21:35:45.348403 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: There has been a growing interest in the role of theory within Software Engineering (SE) research. For several decades, researchers within the SE research community have argued that, to become a real engineering science, SE needs to develop stronger theoretical foundations. A few authors have proposed guidelines for constructing theories, building on insights from other disciplines. However, so far, much SE research is not guided by explicit theory, nor does it produce explicit theory. In this paper we argue that SE research does, in fact, show traces of theory, which we call theory fragments. We have adapted an analytical framework from the social sciences, named the Validity Network Schema (VNS), that we use to illustrate the role of theorizing in SE research. We illustrate the use of this framework by dissecting three well known research papers, each of which has had significant impact on their respective subdisciplines. We conclude this paper by outlining a number of implications for future SE research, and show how by increasing awareness and training, development of SE theories can be improved.

D, [2015-07-23T21:35:45.470420 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) is difficult and time-consuming for an experienced researcher, and even more so for a novice graduate student. With a better understanding of the most common difficulties in the SLR process, mentors will be better prepared to guide novices through the process. This understanding will help researchers have more realistic expectations of the SLR process and will help mentors guide novices through its planning, execution, and documentation phases. Consequently, the objectives of this work are to identify the most difficult and time-consuming phases of the SLR process. Using data from two sources - 52 responses to an online survey sent to all authors of SLRs published in software engineering venues and qualitative experience reports from 8 PhD students who conducted SLRs as part of a course - we identified specific difficulties related to each phase of the SLR process. Our findings highlight the importance of planning, teamwork, and mentoring by an experienced researcher throughout the process. The paper also identifies implications for the teaching of the SLR process.

Of all these, our research line is focused on designing the specific training that members of virtual teams must receive. Universities and companies therefore need to design training schemas to deal with the specifics of GSD, which are principally related to communication difficulties and time and cultural differences. In this work we present the findings of a Systematic Literature Review in the field of GSD training and teaching. Our intention is twofold: on the one hand we wish to discover the existing strategies and proposals available up to the present day, and on the other hand we wish to identify the open challenges, that will be helpful for practitioners and researchers in the future.

This research, inspired by the Impact Project, intends to investigate the technology transfer of software process simulation to the use in industrial settings, and further identify the best practices to release its full potential in software practice. We collected the reported applications of process simulation in software industry, and identified its wide adoption in the organizations delivering various software intensive systems. This paper, as an initial report of the research, briefs a historical perspective of the impact upon practice based on the documented evidence, and also elaborates the research-practice transition by examining one detailed case study. It is shown that research has a significant impact on practice in this area. The analysis of impact trace also reveals that the success of software process simulation in practice highly relies on the association with other software process techniques or practices and the close collaboration between researchers and practitioners.

To attempt to resolve these issues an examination of the non-regulated industry was performed to determine if lessons learned there could be applied to the development of medical device software This examination revealed that agile methods are being widely adopted in the non-regulated software industry. To learn if agile methods could be adopted when developing medical device software a mapping study was performed which looked for instances of where agile methods have been used in regulated industries and where they have been adopted, to what success This mapping study revealed that incorporating agile practices with the existing plan driven SDLC is the most favourable choice for medical device software organizations. This research aims to develop a SDLC which has a foundation of a plan driven SDLC which incorporates agile practices which can be followed when developing regulatory compliant software.

Method-A previously conducted systematic review (Sulayman and Mendes, 2009) has been updated and extended to identify the current state of research on the mentioned topic. Results Eight studies applied SPI techniques or models to small and medium Web companies. The selected studies did not suggest any customized model or technique to measure the SPI of small and medium Web companies. The characteristics of some small and medium companies such as tight budget constraints, tight deadlines and a short term strategy were also identified. The measures of success for small and medium Web companies, as per SR results, include development team and client satisfaction, increase in productivity, compliance with standards and overall operational excellence. Conclusions-The results of this review, like our previously conducted systematic review (Sulayman and Mendes, 2009), show that very few studies have specifically focused on SPI for Web companies, despite the large number of existing Web companies worldwide, and the even larger number of Web applications being currently developed. This clearly indicates a research gap in this area, with numerous avenues for future work.

D, [2015-07-23T21:35:46.161309 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Context: Software systems are increasingly required to operate in an open world, characterized by continuous changes in the environment and in the prescribed requirements. Architecture-centric software evolution (ACSE) is considered as an approach to support software adaptation at a controllable level of abstraction in order to survive in the uncertain environment. This requires evolution in system structure and behavior that can be modeled, analyzed and evolved in a formal fashion. Existing research and practices comprise a wide spectrum of evolution-centric approaches in terms of formalisms, methods, processes and frameworks to tackle ACSE as well as empirical studies to consolidate existing research. However, there is no unified framework providing systematic insight into classification and comparison of state-of-the-art in ACSE research. Objective: We present a taxonomic scheme for a classification and comparison of existing ACSE research approaches, leading to a reflection on areas of future research. Method: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR), resulting in 4138 papers searched and 60 peer-reviewed papers considered for data collection. We populated the taxonomic scheme based on a quantitative and qualitative extraction of data items from the included studies. Results: We identified five main classification categories: (i) type of evolution, (ii) type of specification, (iii) type of architectural reasoning, (iv) runtime issues, and (v) tool support. The selected studies are compared based on their claims and supporting evidences through the scheme. Conclusion: The classification scheme provides a critical view of different aspects to be considered when addressing specific ACSE problems. Besides, the consolidation of the ACSE evidences reflects current trends and the needs for future research directions.

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review that applies the 5W+1H model, which is widely used in the journalism domain, to report the full picture of the research area in both software engineering and services computing. Existing guidelines on systematic literature review heavily rely on the researcher to pose the right research questions, and the review results are tightly focused on these research questions. For researchers new to a field, defining the right research questions that are effective in revealing the critical issues in the field can be challenging. Our case study demonstrates that the 5W+1H model provides an easy aid for the researcher to get over such initial challenges. As the researcher becomes more familiar with the field, he/she may then refine the research questions by adding more topic-specific contexts. In this way, the 5W+1H model serves to provide an exploratory framework to shape a systematic literature review. Applying to software testing for cloud computing, we are able to synthesize a comprehensive picture of recent researches on the field, including publication pattern, article citation immediacy, research topic diversity, research ideas for addressing testing challenges at different cloud service architectural layers. Based on the case study, we summarize the lessons learned on using the 5W+1H model in reporting systematic literature review.

It first appeared in the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference as means to overcome the software crisis. This study aims to investigate how the Software engineering area is evolving, by analyzing the 24 editions of Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES), and understanding which is the impact of international research in this event. A scoping study was performed to figure out how the SE area is evolving and if it suffers influences from international research. We found 512 studies over the 24 SBES editions, which were analyzed and discussed. Based on the analysis, we observed that in the first years there were a few empirical studies; most of them were of theoretical nature. The industry participation and interest still continuous over the editions. Regarding to international impact, we did not find any relation with international research. Our findings suggest that greater attention should be given to the Software Engineering area, with the aim to attract research from industry with real data, and also international collaboration.

D, [2015-07-23T21:35:46.574585 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background: A systematic literature review (SLR) is a methodology used to aggregate all relevant existing evidence to answer a research question of interest. Although crucial, the process used to select primary studies can be arduous, time consuming, and must often be conducted manually. Objective: We propose a novel approach, known as 'Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM, to support the primary study selection activity using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. Method: We conducted a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach. To enable the comparison, we also developed a VTM tool that implemented our approach. We hypothesized that students using SLR-VTM would present improved selection performance and effectiveness. Results: Our results show that incorporating VTM in the SLR study selection activity reduced the time spent in this activity and also increased the number of studies correctly included. Conclusions: Our pilot case study presents promising results suggesting that the use of VTM may indeed be beneficial during the study selection activity when performing an SLR.

This study investigates the effectiveness of using robots as tools in the teaching of introductory programming and to determine whether such technology can help to overcome the current barriers for learners in this context. The systematic literature review (SLR) methodology is used to address this aim. Nine electronic databases, the proceedings from six conferences and two journals were searched for relevant literature and exclusion criteria, and after performing several validation exercises, in total, 75% of included papers report that robots are an effective teaching tool and can help novice programmers in their studies. Most of these papers focus on the use of physical robots, however, and further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of using simulated robots.

D, [2015-07-23T21:35:46.864281 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have become an established methodology in software engineering (SE) research however they can be very time consuming and error prone. Aim: The aims of this study are to identify and classify tools that can help to automate part or all of the SLR process within the SE domain. Method: A mapping study was performed using an automated search strategy plus snowballing to locate relevant papers. A set of known papers was used to validate the search string. Results: 14 papers were accepted into the final set. Eight presented text mining tools and six discussed the use of visualisation techniques. The stage most commonly targeted was study selection. Only two papers reported an independent evaluation of the tool presented. The majority were evaluated through small experiments and examples of their use. Conclusions: A variety of tools are available to support the SLR process although many are in the early stages of development and usage.

D, [2015-07-23T21:38:01.581778 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper focuses on the intrinsic aspects of power management for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in HEVs (PHEV). A vehicle power distribution density function is used to describe the drive cycle characteristics. An electric driveline loss is introduced to describe the minimum system loss for a given mechanical power output, and a piecewise linear fuel consumption model is used to capture essential characteristics such as idle fuel consumption rate, peak efficiency, and the minimum power to reach peak efficiency. Models are based on the assumption that both machines operate at the optimal speed and torque for a given mechanical power as if they are coupled with an ideal continuous variable transmission (CVT). The power management strategy is represented with a pair of power parameters that describe the power threshold for turning on the engine and the optimum battery power in engine-on operations. The model of a parallel hybrid electric powertrain is constructed to obtain optimal solutions that maximize the fuel economy for a given battery energy depletion and for a general vehicle power distribution density function. One-dimensional loss models of two power sources as approximations to real machines coupled with hypothetic CVTs are introduced to solve the optimization problem analytically. It is found that the optimal minimum engine power is the controlling factor in minimizing the total fuel consumption for the given battery energy depletion targets and that the optimal power is solely determined by powertrain characteristics. Numerical simulations validated the properties of the optimal power solutions obtained through analytic approaches. The significance of the results to real-world HEV and PHEV applications are also discussed.

Design of the drive train components for the desired performance of the vehicle no longer based on different formulae. Fuel economy and emission have become the basic constraint. Automaker has to take care of the road transport policies also before deciding the sizes of the drive train components. Modeling and simulation based design method has been adopted by many researchers and automakers. The sizes of drive train components are optimized for the desired performance of vehicle. NERL ADVISOR is one such vehicle simulation software which is used for sizing of the drive train components of HEV. This paper uses simulation on ADVISOR to size the drive train components of hybrid Electric Vehicle for the desired performance.

D, [2015-07-23T21:38:01.871227 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Beginning in 1990, the major automotive passenger vehicle manufacturers once again re-evaluated the potential of the battery powered electric vehicle (EV). This intensive effort to reduce the battery EV to commercial practice focused attention on the key issue of limited vehicle range, resulting from the low energy density and high mass characteristics of batteries, in comparison to the high energy density of liquid hydrocarbon (HC) fuels. Consequently, by 1995, vehicle manufacturers turned their attention to hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). This redirection of EV effort was highlighted finally in 1997, at the 57th Frankfurt Motor Show, the Audi Duo parallel type hybrid was released for the domestic market as a 1998 model vehicle. Also at the 1997 32nd Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota Hybrid System (THS) Prius was released for the domestic market as a production 1998 model vehicle. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the key features of these two 1998 model year production hybrid systems. Among the conclusions, two issues are evident: one, the major manufacturers have turned to the hybrid concept in their search for solutions to the key EV issues of limited range; and, heating/air conditioning; and two, the focus is now on introducing hybrid EV for test marketing domestically

D, [2015-07-23T21:38:02.038077 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Four light duty gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles (Toyota Prius, Honda Civic, Honda Insight and Ford Escape) were tested over five different driving cycles at two temperatures using chassis dynamometer emissions testing procedures. The vehicles were tested at 20degC and -18degC. Second-by-second gaseous emissions and total particle number emissions from the hybrid vehicles show patterns that are in some ways similar to conventional multiport fuel injected gasoline vehicles, with large increases in concentration on accelerations. Under driving conditions where the engine may be turned off and on, or under conditions where the electric drive assists in accelerations, different patterns are observed. These patterns can also differ from one repeat of a driving cycle to another, depending on the state of charge of the battery. Cold temperature operation is very demanding on the electric system of the hybrids. The batteries are challenged not only in starting the vehicle but in retaining charge during operation. These conditions result in much higher fuel consumption and mass emission rates of pollutants and greenhouse gases as compared to standard temperature operation and also greatly influence the transient nature of emissions from these vehicles.

The test bench, which is implemented using relatively low-cost off-the-shelf products, is capable of serving a broad variety of purposes ranging from the design and test of propulsion motor drives to the implementation of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) powertrain control strategies. This paper illustrates the test bench capabilities by (a) simulating the Jeep Commander II, a fuel cell sport utility vehicle (SUV) from Daimler-Chrysler, performing the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS), (b) simulating the Prius, a commercially available gasoline-electric hybrid compact car from Toyota, performing the Japanese "10-15 mode" driving schedule, and (c) determining the efficiency map of a three-phase induction motor (IM). Additionally, the test bench could be also used as a dynamic simulator for renewable energy sources such as wind turbine generators.

D, [2015-07-23T21:38:02.441157 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: This paper addresses system design and integration challenges involved in meeting the requirements for coordinated deployment of Intelligent Hybrid Vehicle Systems. A hybrid vehicle can run purely on a gas engine, purely on an electric motor, or a combination of both. Advanced hybrid vehicles are designed to use a vehicle management system that integrates many subsystem functions into one system. However, many recent hybrid vehicles do not focus on the utilization of decision support techniques for the implementation of system design. The decision support design emphasizes a driver-oriented and automatic-oriented drive-by-wire vehicle system. The top-down functional decomposition and bottom-up physical integration design methodologies help to create an augmented functional analysis in the device level software. The significant portions are devoted to introducing the design stages and establishing the hybrid vehicle management system.

Pulse width modulation (PWM) control methods are examined for operating such a plug-in HEV in mobile power generation and vehicle-to-grid support applications to assess their impacts on the power conversion efficiency. A novel unipolar/interleaved PWM switching scheme is proposed, which can significantly reduce the switching losses and substantially increase the efficiency. A dual inverter drive prototype was assembled to test the PWM control schemes and test results are included to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

A careful balance of power, speed, and control needs to be maintained in order to optimize a vehicle's performance on the racetrack. As UC Irvine's entry into the 2012 Energy Invitational race, Gamma has been a testbed for different drive technologies at some point in time, and is now being used to investigate the effects of active torque bias on vehicle handling under racing conditions.

The idea is to utilize the already available main traction and auxiliary motors and associated power electronics systems of an HEV to construct the charger circuit instead of building a standalone charger. Compared to the latter, it enables significant cost, weight, and volume reductions. The topology was verified by modeling and experimental results on a 14 kW prototype.

D, [2015-07-23T21:38:02.887293 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: A `Gasoline-Electric Hybrid Engine Vehicle' is a vehicle which works on electrical poweras well as fuel like petrol. It has many benefits over its predecessors, which developed power using only fuel. The thought is to design and construct a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) powered by battery as well as petrol. The vehicle is made dynamic in nature by making use of electrical power from battery and fuel power. It consumes less fuel and creates comparatively less pollution as compared to conventional vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles consists of a battery, to drive the electric motor and power system with an IC engine to increase fuel economy reduce harmful emissions from the exhaust. Also there is a provision for recharging the battery using a generator which is run using a turbine, which runs on the exhaust of the IC engine. In HEV, the battery single handedly provides power for driving at low speeds where the efficiency of IC engine is least. In cruising and high load conditions like moving up the hill, the electric power assists the engine by providing additional power. Thus the HEV is the best alternative in areas with high traffic like urban metropolitan cities.

This is achieved by considering a reference electric car of 3150-lb weight similar in body construction, aerodynamics, and rolling resistance to a conventional heat engine car of equal weight, and comparing the performance of the two cars over the same driving modes. The reference electric car is then used as a baseline to evaluate the possible improvements in future electric cars. The energy consumption for an optimized 2000-lb electric car of driving range, comfort, and performance comparable to a conventional car is estimated. Assuming a gradual growth in electric car population leading to their widespread use by the 1990's, the impact on electric power generation and distribution systems is estimated. Though the analysis is based on a high energy and power density battery the results may be extrapolated to electric cars using lower performance batteries. It is noted that batteries with lower energy density can provide sufficient driving range to fulfill a significant portion of our transportation needs and their continued development and improvement will accelerate the achievement of the high energy-density goal [1].

D, [2015-07-23T21:38:04.270144 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: The application of batteries and ultracapacitors in electric energy storage units for battery powered (EV) and charge sustaining and plug-in hybrid-electric (HEV and PHEV) vehicles have been studied in detail. The use of IC engines and hydrogen fuel cells as the primary energy converters for the hybrid vehicles was considered. The study focused on the use of lithium-ion batteries and carbon/carbon ultracapacitors as the energy storage technologies most likely to be used in future vehicles. The key findings of the study are as follows. 1) The energy density and power density characteristics of both battery and ultracapacitor technologies are sufficient for the design of attractive EVs, HEVs, and PHEVs. 2) Charge sustaining, engine powered hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) can be designed using either batteries or ultracapacitors with fuel economy improvements of 50% and greater. 3) Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) can be designed with effective all-electric ranges of 30-60 km using lithium-ion batteries that are relatively small. The effective fuel economy of the PHEVs can be very high (greater than 100 mpg) for long daily driving ranges (80-150 km) resulting in a large fraction (greater than 75%) of the energy to power the vehicle being grid electricity. 4) Mild hybrid-electric vehicles (MHEVs) can be designed using ultracapacitors having an energy storage capacity of 75-150 Wh. The fuel economy improvement with the ultracapacitors is 10%-15% higher than with the same weight of batteries due to the higher efficiency of the ultracapacitors and more efficient engine operation. 5) Hybrid-electric vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells can use either batteries or ultracapacitors for energy storage. Simulation results indicate the equivalent fuel economy of the fuel cell powered vehicles is 2-3 times higher than that of a gasoline fueled IC vehicle of the same weight and road load. Compared to an engine-powered HEV, the equivalent fuel economy of the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle wou- - ld be 1.66-2.0 times higher

D, [2015-07-23T21:38:04.448813 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present a simulation and analytical analysis of the energy conversion efficiency in parallel and series hybrid powertrains. The analytical approach is based on the energy balance equations, whereas the simulation approach is based on an accurate and fast forward-facing simulation model for simulating parallel and series hybrid powertrains. A very good agreement between simulation and analytical results gives confidence pertaining to the accuracy of the performed analysis and confirms the validity of the analytical framework. Thus, combined simulation and analytical analysis enables deep insight into the energy conversion phenomena in hybrid powertrains and reveals the advantages and disadvantages of both hybrid concepts running under different operating conditions. It is obvious from the presented results that the parallel hybrid powertrain features better fuel economy than the series one for the applied test cycles, whereas both hybrid powertrain concepts feature the best fuel economy at light-duty application.

D, [2015-07-23T21:38:04.571852 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: In this paper, the hybridization of a small passenger car equipped with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) is investigated. Designing a hybrid drive train is a multiobjective design problem. The main design objectives are fuel consumption, emissions, and performance. However, it is difficult to find a global optimal integral design solution due to the interdependence of design choices (parameters) regarding the drive-train topology, component sizes, component technologies, and control strategy, as well as the unknown sensitivity of the design objectives to the design parameters. In this paper, a parametric optimization procedure is presented to solve the design problem, where the main design objective is fuel consumption. The effects of parameter variation on fuel consumption have been investigated. Furthermore, a reduced hybrid drive-train model is introduced, with which the effects of design parameter variation is very quickly studied with an average error of less than 1.6%.

D, [2015-07-23T21:38:04.720279 #12666] DEBUG -- : Abstract: Toyota is the pioneer in the hybrid electric vehicle, and today almost all major car assemblers produce hybrid cars. Now, several auto manufacturers are preparing for the commercial launches of battery powered electric vehicles in 2011. Another battle for dominance in electric car market has started. However, the development of technologies for electric cars has a very long history and presently there is a huge diversity of technological solutions in development. In order to understand the evolution of electric vehicles, we carried out two related case studies. In the first case study, we analyze the experience of General Motors in the last 40 years in developing electric vehicles. Our focuses are on the objectives of each development, technologies employed and external factors that stimulated each effort. The results show that in the first 20 years the main objective is to explore different technologies. The intention to launch a commercial electric vehicle only appears in the last 20 years. In the second case study, we analyze propulsion technologies and product architectures electric vehicles announced, in the last few years, by established auto manufacturers and new entrants. The results show that innovations in product architecture can provide a niche market for electric vehicles.
